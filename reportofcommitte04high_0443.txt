NOTES. '269

IV. IARL or earl was, next to king, the title of highest
dignity among the northern nations at the earliest period of
their annals. It appears from this passage that they used
it as early as the age of Ossian, who restricts it to a chief of
Lochlin.--M0rmhair was the highest title of nobility
among the ancient Scots‚ and still continues among the
speakers of Gaelic to be applied to earl 01· lord‚ as
banamhor’air is to countess.
