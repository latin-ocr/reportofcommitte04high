3· REPoRT oN THE

pose3 nothing less will so much as command the at-
tention of the public.

Becket tells me that he is²to give us a new edi-
tion of your Differtation, accompanied with some
remarks on Temora. Here is a favourable opportu-
nity for you to execute this purpose. You havela
just and laudable zeal for the credit of these poems.
They are, if genuine, one of the greatest curiofities
‘in all Υεῖρεᾶε, that ever was discovered in the com*
monwealth of letter-83 and the child is, in a man-
ner, become yours by adoption, as Macpherson has ·
totally abandoned all care of it. These motives call
‘upon you to exert yourseff, and I think it were suit„
able to your candour, and most satisfaetoly also to
the reader, to publilh all the answers to all the let-
ters you write, even though some of these letters
{hould make somewhat against your own opinion in
this affair. We {hall always be the more affured
that no arguments are strained beyond their proper
force, and no contrary arguments suppressed, where
such an entire communication is made to us. Beck-A
et joins me heartily in this application ; and he owns
to me, that the believers in the authenticity of the
poems diminish every day among the men of sense
and refleffion. Nothing less than what I propose
can throw the balance on the other fide. Ι depart
⁴{rom hence in about three weekS, and should be

glad to hear your resolution before that time.
