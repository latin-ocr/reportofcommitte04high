Lss'rrms ‘ro MR. MACKENZIE, &aa ὂς

{ng learned that he was possessed of some picces of the
oldest Highland poetry in the original, requested of him to
show him a translation of one or two of those picces, as a
specimen. Two of these, which were afterwards publish-
ed among the Fragments, were accordingly given to M r
Home, who admired them greatly, and at some distance of
time showed thern to rne as valuable curiosities.

I being as much struck as Mr Home with the high spirit
of poetry which breathed in them, presently made enquiry
where Mr Macpherson was to be found; and having sent
for him to come to me, had much conversation with him
on the subject. then I learned that, besides the few
pieces of that poetry which he had in his possession, great-
er and moreconsiderable poems of the same strain were to
be found in the Highlands, and were well known to the na-¹
tives there, Ι urged him to translate the other pieces which
he had, and bring them to me3 promising that I should
(take) care to circulare and bring them out to the public, by
whom they well deserved to be known. He was ext-reme-
ly reluctant and averse to comply with my request‚ saying,
that no translation of his could do justice to the spirit and
force of the original3 and that, besides injuring thern bg:
translation, he apprehended they would be very ill relish-
ed by the public as so very different from the strain of mo-
dern ideas, and of modern, connected, and polished poei‘ry.
It was not till after much and repeated importunity on my
part, and representing to him the injustice he would do to
his native country by keeping concealed those hidden trea-
sures, which, I assured him, if brought forth, would
serve to cnrich the whole learned world, that I at length
prcvailed on him to translate, and bring to me, the several
poetical pieces which he had in his possession. Them'l
published in 1760, under the title of Fragments of Ancient
Poetry, collected in the Hzgrhlands qucotland, and wrote the.
