DAUGHTER OF MEY. 10¹9

Though pale with sear, she plunges in the wax-e,
And to the hero’s hand a dagger gave :

Alas ! too late ; yet gath’ring all his force,
He‘drags, at last, his hissing foe to land.
Yet there the battle still grew worse and worse,
And long the conflict lasted on the strand.
At length he happily descry'd a part,
Just where the scaly neck and breast did meet 3
Through this he drove a well-directed dart,
And laid the monster breathless at his feet.
The lovers shoutecl whenthey saw him dead,
While from his trunk they cut the bleeding head.

But soon the venom of his morta] bite
ᾗ Within the hero’s bosom spreads like {lame ;
His face grew pale, his strengssh forsook him quite,
And o’er his trembling limbs a numbness carue.
Then sainting on the siimy shore he fell,
v And utter’d, with a heavy, dying grean,
These tender words, “ My lovely maid, farewell l
Remember Albin; for his life is gone !''’
These sounds like thunder all her sense opprest,
And swooning down she fell upon his bre-ast.

At last, the maid awak'ning as from sleep,
Felt all her 301ss o’erwhelm'd in deep despair,
Her eyes star'd wild, she rav’d, she could not weep‚
She beat 'her bosom, and she tore her hair !
She look’d now on the ground, now on the skies,
Now gaz’d around, like one imploring aid.
But none was near in pity to 'ner eries,
No comfort came to soothe the hapless maid 2
Then grasping in herv palm, that shone like snow,
The youth’s dead hand, she thus expres’d her woe.
