OF PASSAGEs. 2:39

Cormac was there in his camp,

Resolutely awaiting us

With seven able warriors.

When the people of Cormac turned towards us„

The hill seemed to flamc.

Eight were the force of stately Cormac,

Equal in deeds of arms among the Fir-belg:-

Colla’s son, and Durra of woumls,

The mighty son of Toscar, and Tago 5-

Frestal the battling son of the king,

Dairo of the happy deeds,

Daol the bulwark of the narrow way,

vXvVho bore the standard of graceful Con-nac,

Eight were the heroes of high-born Ossian, Ὗ

ΑΗ of equal might to guard him in stormy war,

Muuo, and the genereus son of Skenn,

Skehiche, the trusty and the noble among heroes,

F illan, and Cairdal the wrathful‚

And Du-mac-Rebhin of the steady spear.

Toscar‚ placed on the western flank,

Marched under our ensign staff against the Fir-belg³
Tosear and Daol met

Side to side, on the field of combatants.

The battle of the two lovely champions
