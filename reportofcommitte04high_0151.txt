POEMs oF OSSIAN. 133

Itis needless to enter into any particular illustra-
tion‚ to ssoew how simple and natural this pic‘Tture of
Fingal is in the-“original3 how much altered from
that fimplicity in Maepherson’s transsation. In the
original the picture prompts the words; in Mac-
pherson’s transsation, the expreffion is thought· of,
without attending to the picture. Maepherson wishes
to give an explanation or commentary to his reader ς
he will not trust to his understanding or feeling the
meaning and force of the fimple expreffion in the
original, ⁴ He saw the winds without force‚’ but
tells, by an interpolation, what that expression im-
ports. ‘ His dzzrkened brow bends for-ward to the
coast ; he looks back to the lagging wind? He makes
his silence terrible‚ when there was no one to see or
feel terror from it. The original, fazoin, which it is
difficult to find an exact English word for, means
something light, vain, that has no consequence ot·
meaning.

⁸ Thuit oidhch’ air Rotha nan stuadh 3
Ghabh cala nan emach an long;
Bha carraig mu iomall a' chuain
Dh' aom ,coille thar fuaim nan tomis

⁶ Night fell on Rotha of the waves 5
The harbour of little hills received the skip.
There was a rock ou the edge of the sea;
The wood bcndiug over the found of the wavesv’

⁶ Nig'ht came down on the sem Rotha’s bay received tlv-
ΜΡ. A rock bends along the coast, with all its cehoilg w‹›0a⁷.’
