14 LETTERS TO DR. BLAIR.

that manuscript. But those who suppose, or maythink,
that Mr Maepherson was at the pains to consult several
different rehearsers, and to compare their various editions,
must suppose, and think at the same time, that he had an
undoubted right, like every editor who collates several dif-

of some poems, rendered into English by him, are, in not
a few instances, rather better than those corresponding with
them in the translation, however masterly that undoubted-

age to age, and transmitted down to the present, without
any material corruptions ?

The answer which Mr Blacpherson has made himself to
this question in his Dissertation concerning the antiquity,
&Q of Ossian's poems, seems to me satisfactory enough.
Should it be thought necessary to add any thing to what he
has said, under that head, I would take the liberty to offer
the following observations :——-
