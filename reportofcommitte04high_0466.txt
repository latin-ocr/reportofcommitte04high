It appears from the words “ Ut ea ferebat aetas‚’-' that
O Flaherty considered the tale of the TAIN as a composi-
tion of the age to which it relates: So that the Gritical
Exposition prefixed to this ancient copy must have escaped
the diligent and successful search that he made for materiale
to his Ogygia. And as he was the friend aud pupil of the
family of Mac Firbis, the most learned and intelligent of
the professed Antiquarians of lreland †‚ there is reason to
believe that the Exposition in question, was not only writ-
ten, but composed in scotland, and that it was either un-
known to the Irish Antiquaries, or overlooked by them.

Be that as it may, it sets forth that Sheanachan, with the
three chief bards, and those in their retinue, being called
upon for the history of the T din blm, or cattle SpoiL of
Guailgne, when they were taking their departure from the
Court of Guaire‚ acknowledged themselves ignorant of it.
That they made their grand rounds of Ireland and of Scor,-
Iand in quest of it, but to no purpose ss. That Eimin and
Muircheartach‚ two of their number repaired at length to
the grave of Fergus son of Roich‚ who, being invoked‚ ap-
peared at the end of three days in awfnl majoety, and re-
cited the TAIN from beginning to end, as it is detailed in
the twelve Reimsgeala‚ or Portions, of which it is made
up.

The historical Anecdotes begin with that which is en-
graved on Plate II. herewith presented, and relates to Ossian
theson ofFinga1‚ whom it represents as showing an inclina-
tion in early life, to indulge in solitudo his natural propensity
to meditation and song. It is to be read as follows:
