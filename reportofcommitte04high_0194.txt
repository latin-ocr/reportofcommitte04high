,ἐῶ LETTERS TO DR. BLAIR-

from the translation3 Fingal‚ book iv. pages 49, 50, and
51.

Neil M‘Murrich, a native of this country, who with
his predecessors for nineteen generations back have been
the bards and historians of the family of Clanranald, (it
being customary with every Highland family of note to
have bards and historians of old,) repeated before me the
whole of the poem of Darthula, or Clan-Usnoch, with few
variations from the translation, which he declared he saw and
read, together with many more, in a manuscript which
underwent the same fate with the manuscript already made
mention of. Dcclared also, that he is of opinion, the last
poem in the collection, Berrathon, is contained in a manu-
script which I myself saw him deliver‚ with three or four
more, to Mr Macpherwn, when he was in this* country,
and for which Mr Blacplierson gave him a missive, oblig-
ing himself to restore it, which shows that in the opinion
of both, the manuscript contained something of* great im,-
portance. John Ossian is yet alive in Hamis, and was to
be transportcd to the Isle of Sky, as I was credibly in-
formed, to be examined by Mt James Nicolson, minister
of Durinish, otherwise I would have got him examined.
Though all that I have above offered will, I fear, be of
*little consequence towards promoting your undertaking3
yet I hope that other Highlauders, better qualified for tho
purpose, will surnish you with as many testimonies, for
the authenticity of these poemS, as will enable you to estab-
lish with the world the credit due to them. As your con-
cern for truth and for the honour of your country, justly
entitle you to the thanks and good wishes of all your couna-
>trymen, be pleased to accept of mine, and believe that Ι
iam, ‘with great esteem,

Reverend deur brother,
Your affectionate brother, and ”
most obedient servant,
ANGL’S MAC- Nerei«
