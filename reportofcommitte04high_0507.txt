of POEMS.

μ Since then to me the glory fell
Thy valour to subdue,

My arm shall now thy foes repel‚
Not injure those who sue.

For thou thyself an hero art,
Though fortune on thee frown3
Rise therefore free, and free depart,

With unimpair’d renown.

Or chuse, strong arm of powerful might Ξ
Chuse‚ Magnus, now thy course ':
With genereus foes in peace unite,
Or dare again their force.

Botter our friendship to engage,
And be in peace ally'd,
Than thus eterna] warfare wage,

Defying and defy'd.’'

ε O never more my arm, through life,
Against thee, Fiun, shall rise 2

O never such ungrateful strife
Shan Mehee’s son devise 3

And O ! that on their hills of snow
My youths had still rmnain’d,

Nor thus against a generous foe
Unprosperous war maintain’d ἔ

Exulting in their conscious might,
And glorying in their fame,

And gay with spoils of many a sight,
,And flush'd with hope they came ἔ
