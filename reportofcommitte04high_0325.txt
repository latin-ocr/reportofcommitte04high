v⁴1*sz Mistakes which have been noticed are but a few of
*3²² the Poem of URN<IGH OSSIAN contains, Nor are the
-other poems in the collection mone exempt from error.
Two instances to be taken from the first of these which is
-entitled Ossian ugus cm Clerich will suffice.

Stanza 26. “ Se huirt an Tosgar bu mhor Brigh

·’“ ‘Diongamsa Riogh Inse-Tore

“ S Cinn a Dha chomhirlich dheig

‘⁶ Leig faoi ’m choimh-ir fein an coisg.’⁹
Translated, ‘⁶ Then says Osear of mighty strength, ‘ Give
‘⁶‘ me the King of Inistore [the Islcmd <gf Wild Boars ,·] his
'⁴‘ twelve nobles have a sweet voice, leave me to quel!
‘⁶ them.’'

The actual signification of 'Inse-Tore, or rather Inse tois,
is of the eastern Isle ,· but the translator seems to have read.
it, as it was probably reched, hee-tore, which means, (fthe
island qf bom-s.

Cinn a dha chomhirlich dheig, significes the heads qs his
mvelt-e counsellors. The erroneous translation appears to

have proeeeded from the translator’s taking Cinn, heads, for
„binn‚ sweet qs voice, or musical, and not understanding the
meaning of chomhirlich‚ counsellors.

Stanza 31. l. 3. ‘⁶ Meirg Riogh Loehlan an aigh’‘ is trans-
lated ‘⁶ the ison King of Lochhn,” instead of thestamlaml (ff
Lochlin’s auspicious Kz'tzg.

It is not withouz' regret that I have observed the Enquiry
of a writer possessed of learning, ingenuhry, and candens,
thus teeming with errors3 which proceeded in part from
his being an entire stranger to the Ianguage in which the
poems he sought after were mmpoaed, and were, in part,
owing to the ignoranee of his scribes and translat-ors,
