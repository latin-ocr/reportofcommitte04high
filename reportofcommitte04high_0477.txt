Christian Doctrina. But yet it must be acknowledged to
be much inferior to the ancient mode of orthography‚ which
has not only the advantage of being grounded on a know-
ledge of the principles of grammar, and philosophy of
language, but of being also more plain and easy.

This volume of the Dean's is Curious, as distinguishing
the genuine poetry of Ossian from the imitations made of it
by later bards, and as ascertaining the degree of accuracy
with which ancient poems have been transmitted by tradi.
tion for the last 300 years, during a century of which the
order of bards has been eminet, and ancient manners and
customs have suffered a great and rapid change in the
Highlands.

In the number of bards who assumed the story of Ossi-
an’s heroes for their subject, and attempted his manner, is
Muireach Albanach, who must have flourished towards the
close of the 13th century; for the fourth in descent from
him pronounced the Prosnacha catha, or Incitement to battle,
on the field of Harlaw the 25th July 1411, as is shewn by
a Genealogy which Niel Mac Vuirich wrote in Benbecula
the llth July 1775, for the late Dr. Walker‚ professor of
natural history in the University of Edinburgh. Among
these imitators‚ Ailen mac Ruairi‚ 01· Allan son of Rorie,
is ‚easily distinguished as the most successful in poetic
imagery and harmony of numbers. Yet it is obvious that
he could not attain either the simplicity or majesty of his
model.

Some of the more ancient poems in the MS. under con-
sideration are altogether, or nearly, the same with what 'ap-
pear in another Collection belonging to the Society, which
was made by Mr. Duncan Kennedy from oral tradition five
and twenty years ago ἕ ; and others of them agree with
pieces received from different parts of the Highlands and
Isles‚ where they‘were likewise taken down from ora}
recital.
