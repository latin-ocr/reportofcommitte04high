β LETTERS TO DR. BLAIR.

Ι am not atall surprised that, at a time when the spirit of
party, and national quarrels, are risen to such a height, the.-
authenticity of Ossian’s poems should be called in question.
The glory arising to our country and ancestors, fr0m these
noble monuments of genius, cannot miss to give pain to
the malevolent in the southern division of the Isle3 and,
as a great person who has patronized F ingal, must not only
be depressed, but made as little as possible in every re-
spect, Mr Macpherson must be involved in the same cruel
persecution. ι

But to come directly to the questions you propose--I arn
not able to say, with any degree of certainty,3that I have
seen, but can affirm that Ι have not perused, any MSS.

out, or examine, such papers 3 and the Isle in which I
live at present can hardly afford such curiosities. About
twenty years back, Iwas settled in a part of the country
where there was an ancient little family, the head of which
united the professions of the bard, genealogist, and sennaf

know, was a man of some letters, that is to say, he and
his ancestors, for many ages, had received their education
in Irish Colleges of poetry and history, and understood
the Latin tolerably well. The man who was of my ²⁶⁴!
quaintance, was thought an antiquary‚ in the Highland
acceptation of the word, and had some MSS. in his pssosf
session. But he is dead long since, and his office abolish-

gentleman may very probably have all the MSS. formerly
belonging to these old laureats, if preserved, ih his custody a
and though Iunderstood by your letter that Macleod has
undertaken to write to Clanranald upon this subject, I have,
immediately after receiving yours, written to the Minister
:cf the parish where these'bards lived3 and intreated him,-
