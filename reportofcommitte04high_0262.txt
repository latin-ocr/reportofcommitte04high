813 LETTERS To M-R. MACKENZIE·

century3 as Nial Frasach‚ one of the characters introduc-
ed in 11, was an Irish king, who abdicated his throne, and
retired to the monastery of Icolumkill, where he died in
765. Mr M. however seems to have either seen or heard
of this poem, as he observes in a note that the traditionary
account of Darthula's death was, that she ended her days
by suicide; which is the account given of Deardruin in

Hc speaks of her borrowing a knife, and afterwards we
find her dead, on the body of Nathos. The concluding
verses, which mention two yews as growing from their
graves, and entwining their branches on high, make a
part, if I remember rightly, of some other of ΜΓ M.'s
translations, but I do not recollect which. Ι remain, with
este-ern,

Dear Sir,
Your most humble servant,
JOHN 5111111.

ters, copies, or memorandums of them, nor had any occa-
sion, except what you gave me, of say-ing almost any
thing about them, my recollection does not wari-ant me
now to add any thing more precise to the general account
which Ι then gave of them. Since that time, indeed, I do
not think that I ever read a single page of them. Last
