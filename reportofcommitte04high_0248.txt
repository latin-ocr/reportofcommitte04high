'‘ir'l· LETTERS TO MR, MACKENZIE.

became a student in philosophy, when, in the year 1766
or 1767, Ι read ΜΓ Macpherson’s translation, with which,
beautiful as it is, I was by no means so much charmed as
I had been with the oral recitation of such as I had heard
of the poems in the original language. The elegance of
the modern dress did not therefore, in my opinion, com-
pensate for the loss of the venerable and ancient garb. In
reading the translation, Ι recognized a number of poems,
episodes, and passages, which were familiar to me. Some
of the poems, and parts of poems, were, however, new
to me; and others which Ἰ knew, and supposed to have
considerable merit, I desiderated. Of a number of these
last, I procured several editions some years afterwards ;
but did not trouble myself or others with collecting those
which had been already translated, as it was then expected
that Μι- Maepherson himself would soon publish them.
'W'hen this however became doubtful, Ῑ remember to have
formed the design of collecting as many as I could of his
originals, which at that time would not be a few: but
finding there was no encouragement to be expected for such
a work, and that those which I had already collected
would not defray their own expence, nor have been ever
pnbllshed had it not been sor the liberal support ancl pa-
tronage of the Highland Society of London, I gave up the
pursuit os Gaelie poetry; about which I became so care-
less, that Ι never took the trouble of transcribing οι· pre-‚r
sem-ing several pieces that had fallen into my possession.
Some Ι lost, some· I gave away, and some still meet me in
the bosom of this or the other book. Hadl had the second
sngZJt to foresee that such things would one day be in re-
quest‚ I might have now had many, In the original
pocms and translations which I had published‚ I had occa-
sion to introduce several passages 'of Mr Maepherson’s ori-
ginals into the note53 sor, without searching· for them, I
had got considerable portions of several of those poems
