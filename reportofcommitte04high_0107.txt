The MS. which accompanied ΜΓ Anderson’s let-
ter wasv stitched in the form of a very small memo-
randum book, and consisted of two poems 3 one on
Deam, and another, a sort of heroic poem, in seve-
ral cantos, written, as appeared from some memo-
randums on one of its leaves, by Mr Maepherson‚
when he taught a school in Badenoch. It contained
no evidence of the fni-gery of Offizm, *which Mr
Laing suspected, nor indeed any other evidence con-
nected with this subjeet, except in so far as it shewed
ΜΓ Macpherson to have been, as he says himself in
one of his prefaces, an early apprentice to the muses.
To shew what he had then acquired insuch appren-
ticeship, a specimen of each poem is annexed in the
Appendix, No. 6. .

Mr Maepherson's papers (called by him the ori-
ginal of Offim), above described, were left, as has
been said to ΜΓ John Mackenzie, for the purpose
of publication 3 and it is now understood will be
published, as soon as some preliminary difficulties
can be ovcrcome.
