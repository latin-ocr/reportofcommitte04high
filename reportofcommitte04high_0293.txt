ἢ( possession of ‘Fingal and his Heroes? I prefer them to
Β thy God, and thee, O Patrickv’ So Purchas relates*,
that, when the Spaniards attempted to convers ὼε in-
habitants of the Philippinesslsles to Cl1ristianity3 the
islanders replicd, that they would rather be in hell with
their forefathers, than iu heaven with the Spaniards.

According to M⁴Nab, Fingal seems to have been the
Odin of the Scots: for he said, they had no religion, prior
to Christianity, but the reverence of Fingal and his race-
This account agrees with the entire ‚deficiency of religiono·
ideas, in the Ossian of Maepherson and Smith 3 and with,
the opinions ancl prejudices expressed in the following
Poem.

The Urnigh Ossian evidently appears, even through ‚tlpe
medium of the following rude translation, to be superior in
poetic merit to any of the Songs which accompany it. I
am very sorry the translation is not entire. The first twen-v
ty-one verses, and the last verse, or thirty-sixffi, were trans-
lated for me at Oban in Argyleshire, by a schoolmaster
there3 who was procured by ΜΓ. Hugh Stephensop, inn-
keeper at Oban. The remainder of the translation wa„
ssent me from Edinburgh‚ in Consequence of Dr. Willan's
,applicatiou. “’
