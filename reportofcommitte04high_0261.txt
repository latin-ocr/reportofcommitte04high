LETTERS To MR. MACKENZIE. δ’(

translation, when 116 had. probably several editions of which
the one would enable him to correct or amend the other,
’,Ι could, in many instances‚ account *for the difference by
⁴the change of a single letter in words of a similar sound5
although I am far from thinking, that the translator attend,-²
ed much to a scruptilous exactness in his version. Is my
letter had not been already long, and my sheet near full, Ι
would have given you a version of a few passages of one
or two more of the poems, particularly of the Battle qs*
Lora, although the edition of it too is very imperfect. I
>once had, and think I still have, an edition of that poem,
which I suppose is more correct. I wonder Mr M’L. left
out, as he says he did, about a dozen of stamas, describ-

translated by Μι- Μ. When I can lay my hand on my
copy, I may perhaps send you them, with a literal ver-

imperfect as it is, which I do not recollect to have noticetl
before. The poet, after having confessed that half his
people fell in that battle, says, that if he were to swear by
the sun, he could not say that above a :third of them escap-

I was much disappointed in reading the poem, entitled
*Clann Uz’lmeachczilz, (or Clann Usnothain) whichss'l thought,
from the title, might be the original of Darthula3 but
which is so far short of it, in point of incident aud
imagery, that I do not think it is so much as a bad
,edition of a poem which I heard long ago repeated
under the name cf Clam Usteotl·c22'.rz, and of which Ι
have since heard good judges speak in high ternis, as
the original of Darthula. The first part of the poem in
your posessioo, which seems to have little or no connec-
¹tion with the second. is evidently a composition of the Stil
