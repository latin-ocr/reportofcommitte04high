The young heroes of Fingal fell,

Adorned with a robe of fame.

The sons of Louach fell, .

The fix sons and the father.

The youth of Albion fell,

Slain are the heroes of Britain.

Fallen is the king of Lethlin's son?

Who always gave us his aid. ’
Generous and manly was his beart ς
Strong, at all times, was his arm.”

‘⁴ But tell me, bard 1

The son of my son, and of my loins,
Osear, how did he hew down the terrible ,battle 5
It were hard to relate,

Great were the tassz to tell, i

'The numbers ssain in that battle,

Who fell by the arms of Osear.

Not swifter the catara& ‚of a river,

Nor a hawk darting on a flight of bird-a t,
Not stronger the course of the foaming torrent,
Than Oscar in that battle.

He waS‚ at last,

Like a branch that opposes a furious wind7
Or like a tree which budding green
Refists the stroke of the woodman.

When he perceived ,the king of Exin

In the midst of his host,

Forward Oscar rushed,

As rolls a wave to the shore.

As Cairbar saw him approach,

He wielded his keen spear,

And pierced him through with its point-.-
Our chief cause of woe 2

Nor yet did Oscar turn,

But forward pushed to Erin’s king:

A wound with might he gave,

Which proved the strength of his blade.
