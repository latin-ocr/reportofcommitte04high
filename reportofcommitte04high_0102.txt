⁶ My· LoRD,

‘ Having, in consequence os different
conversations with-Mr Mackenzie and your Lord-
ship, renounced the idea of publishing ΜΓ Hume's
two letters to Dr Blair, relative to Offian's poem8‚
I understand that the Highland Society, in the course
of the summer, are to pu'blish, with these letters,
Dr Blair's correspondence on the subject entire, to-
gether with all the letters and other evidence which
they have received on the authenticity of Offian's

poems.
