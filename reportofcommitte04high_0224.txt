50, THE ΤΕΞΤΙΜΟΝΥ oF

It is also well known, that learned men lived for many
centuries in Icolmkill, from which learning was diffused
over the Highlands; and it is reasonable to believe, that
Ossian's poems were taken down in wri‘ting‚ like other
parts of learning, and transmitted to their followers. But
when Icolmkill was abandoned, and their books carried by
them to Glasgow, the Gaelic was then in less esteem.

But the severest blow which our language has ever re-
ceived, was the removal of the Royal F amily to England,
and the attendance of our men of rank and influence at
Court; who were carrying back to their country the man-
ners and language of England and of the Lowlands.

From that period, 'more frequent intercourse was obtain-
ed between the Highlanders and the people of the south.
And Government exerted its utmost power for the destruc-
tion of the Gaelic language‚ and Highland manners, until
by degrees the Highlanders were losing their respect and
esteem for the manly and original language of their an-
cestors.

The case was different with the Irish Gaidhil, who had
less connection with any other language ; and therefore re-
tained unadulterated the Old Gaelic hand-writing, after it
ceased to be used in the Highlands.

It was customary with Highland gentlemen to write in
Latin or Gaelic, before they became acquaintcd with the
English tongue. This is well known to have been the
case with Rory Mor, chief of the Niac Leods, who was
the last chief among us who retained this practice.

It is an universal tradition and belief among us, in every
part of the Highlands and Isles, that Ossian attained to a
great age, and was blind in his latter years. Hence, wc
say of a man who has lost all his friends, and the compa.-
nions of his youth, and who has the missortune to survive
them, “ Tha e mur Qisein an' deigh na F fidene. ⁷' He is.
like Ossian after the Feinc.
