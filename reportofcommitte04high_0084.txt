66 REPORT ON THE

The broken found of thy name
From the mouth of Ogffl, to speed thee !—

But I fear thou wilt not return.’

Her perplexity between her defire to go to the as· ⁷

fistance of her husband, and her fear of leaving her
infant behind her in the boat, is described with in-
finite tenderness‚ aud concludes with a simile as ap-
propriate as it is beautiful.

‘ She glanced by the scanty beam
On the beautiful face of her son,
When about to leave him in her marrow ssziff.-
‘⁶ Habe of my love l be here unobserved !''-—·
Ac a dove on the rock of Ul'achm
Vv⁷hen gatl›2†1·.ng herides for her tendet· brood,
Returm often without tasting them, ’
W'hile th: hawk rises in her thoughts;

· So returned three times Evirchoma,

Her foul as a wave that is toffed
From breaker to breaker, when the tempest blows‚
Till {he heard a mournful voice from the tree of the shore)

The dying action of Evirchoma is a stroke of ma-
ternal tenderness not less expreffive. nor less touch,
ing, for the fimplicity with which it is described.

‘ I lifte'd his helmet 3 I saw his locks
Dilorder'd‚ uneven in sweat.
My cry arose,
And he raised with difficulty his eye.
Death came, like a cloud on the sun 3—-

No more {halt thou see thy Oscar.
The beauty of Evirchoma is darken'd.

Her son, unconcern'd, holds the end of a spear.
