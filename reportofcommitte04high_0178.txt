ᾗ· LETTERS TO DR. BLAIR.

abandoned me along with the sceptics long ago· But after
wondering at his absurdity, who has it in his power at once
to put the matter beyond a question, I doubt much whether
any other man can do it. All the manuscripts of conse-
1, quence are in his hands 3, and he alone knows from what
parts of* the Highlands, aud from what person5‚ he col-
lected them. By obtaining these from him, and⁴ procuring
certificates from the persons in whose possession they have.
‘formerly been, ancl comparing them with the translation,
something might be done τ but I have little hopes that any
manuscripts will be round in the Highlands, which have
not already fallen into his hands. These Islands never were
possessed of any curious manuscripts, as faras Ι can learn,
except a few which Clanranald had, and which are all in
Maepherson’s possession. The few bards that are left
among us„ repeat only detached pieces of these poems. I.
have often heard', and understood them3 particularly from
one man called John Mac Codrur‘n, who lives upon my
estate of North Uist. I have heard him repeat, for hours
s together„ poems which seemed to me to be the same with
Maepherson’s translation 3, but as I· had. it not along with
ine, and could not remember it with sufficient exactneSS, I
¹cannot positively affirm that what I have heard is precisely
the same with the translation. As I made no doubt of its
being the same, Imighx also, on that account, give less
attention to discover any small. differences. The man
whom you mention, by the name οἱ John Ossian, lives in
Hams. I have heard nothing of him since I came last to
this country3 but was told, when I· was here before, that
he could repeat more of these poems than any man. in these
Islands. I shall contrive to get him, and the other man I
*mentioned to you, examined in the way you propose, in
presence of some people who are proper judges, and get a
faithful report ofA the result of this trial. I am sorry my<
own engagements will not allow me to remain long enough
