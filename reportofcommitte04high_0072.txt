wards controversy, satisfied with producing authori-

from them.

As the pamphlet of ΜΓ Hill is not in general cir-
culation, a specimen os the poetry which he colleffih
ed, and of the remarks which it suggested to him,
are inserted in the Appendix, No. VIII. To these
are subjoined some remarks on Mr Hill’s publica-

tion,

countrymen estimated so highly. Scotland was, in some degree,
a foreign country to Johnson. His peculial· talent might per-
haps be said to confist in clothing ordinary sentiments in imperial
language ; but he had the skill to make the garment fit so well,
that, like handicrafts dressed for a pageant, the proper rank and
value of the sentiments were frequently forgotten in the gorgeons-
ness ofatheir robes. Were the chax-aecer of Johnson and of his
writings to be drawn *with that severity which he sometimes in-
dulged in his account of others, considerable deduffion would
be made from the merita of both3 yet, with all the abatements
which such severity might state, it would still leave behind a cha-
ra&er of extraordinary powers and unc'ommon endowments, of
wisdom, discernment, imagkration, learning, piety, benevolence,
which their attendant weakneffes (weaknesses greatly owing to
an originally morbid constitution), dogmatism‚ prejudicc‚ super-
stition, and partiality‚ though they might sometimes obscure or
missead, could never extinguish or altogether overcome. The
Society will pardon its Committee sor this note, which it hopes
will not be thought imper-tinent in mentioning a man to whom
national prejudice on either side of the Tweed has often been
partial or unjust, and whose decifion on the subje& of the Com-
mittee’s inquiries hasbeen adopted on one fide, or censured on
the other, with deference or contempt alike unwarrautable and
unfounded. ’
