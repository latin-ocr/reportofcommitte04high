’ S i lenm ar eilid an fhasaich.

San hraich b’ionan do cheum

Is easach a leam thar charraige,

Tr'a sgaoileas e cheo glas

Air’ gaothaibh, ’se bras ro Mhora.

Tha crainn is tuilm na gthaeaibh

Gus am fairtlich a mhuir mhor air.

Cha ghluais e'n sm an dulleag,

Mur cuidich leis neart nan ioma-ghaoth.
-Air ioma-ghaoith gabhsa do thuras,
A mhic o Duibhne, gu cuideachd nan Treun’ar:
’S a thriath threun a b’ailli’ leadan

Na aon fhleasgach tha san Fheinn’,

Gu ma samhach a robh tbrchuh

Fo chudrom na foide re Ρ

Of which his transsation is as follows z

‘ Thy strength was like the strength of streams in their foam ;
thy speed like the eagle of Atha, darting on the dun trembling
fawn of the desart. In battle thy path was like the rapid fall of
a mountain stream, when it pours its white torrent over the rock,
and sends abroad its grey mists {upon the Wi11gs of the wind-s.
The roar of its stream is loud through Mora’s rocks. Mountajn
trees, with all their moss and earth, are swept along between its
arms: but when it reaches the calm sea of the vale, its strength
is lost, and the noise of its course is filent. lt moves not the
w'ithered leaf, if the eddying wind doth not aid it. On eddyiug
winds let thy spirit be borne, son of Duino, to thy fathers 3 but
light let the turf lie over thy beauteous form, and calm in the
grave be th}y ssumber.’
