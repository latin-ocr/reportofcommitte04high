’76 LETTERS TO MR. MACKENZIE.

edition of the original, the translation may not exactly cor-
respond with any single edition that may now be found.
from having compared the original and translation of a
few passages and parts of poems many years ago, the
impression that remains upon my mind is, that the liberty
taken was no more than Ι thought allowable3 and Ι am
persuaded, that it would have appeared to be still less if I
had the translator's own edition.

In what Ι have said, Ι wish to be understood as speak-

translator inadvertently mistook the meaning, which could
not well be supposed to have been the case, if, as some al-
leclged‚ any part of it was of his own composition. As
