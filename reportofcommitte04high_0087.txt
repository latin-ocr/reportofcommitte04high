POEMs OF OSSIAN. 69

THE BED oF GAUL.

‘ O spread the bed of Gaul, ye sons of the strings,
and his sun-beam close by him, where his bed may
be marked from afar, though overlhadowed with
lofty boughs; under the oak of the greenest blow,
that quickest grows, and of the most lasting hue,
that pours out her leaves on the breath of the
shower, though the field all around be withered.
Her leaves, from the utmost bounds, shall be seen
by the birds os summer, and every bird, as he
comes, alights on the top of the bough os strumen.
Gaul shall hear their chaunting in his mist, and vir-
gins finging of Evirchoma. Till the succeeding
changes take place, the memory of you {hall not be
torn asunder. Till the stone moulder into dust,—-
till with age this branch shall wither,——till the brooks
cease to run,—till the source of the mountain stream
run dry,—till in the fiood of time be lost the age of
every bard, song, and subje& of every* tale 3—the
stranger shall not ask, ‘ Who is the son of Morm'?'
or, ⁶ KVhere dwells the king of Strumon ,θ’
