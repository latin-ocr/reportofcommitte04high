Harlaw', which was fought near four hundred years ago.
It is called Brosnachadh cath Ghariach, (invigorating ad..
dress at the battle of Garioch,) and is well known.

As a proof of the estimation in which the bards were
held, I need only mention, that when the chief of the
Mac Leods dismissed Mac Gille Riabhich‚ his family·
bard, Maedonald received him hospitably‚ though he had
always his own family bard‚ and gatte him lands on the
farm of Kilmorey, in Trotternish, which retain to this
day the name of Baille mhic Gine Riablfich, (Mac Gille
Riabhich’s town.) Now, it is weil known that when the
persons succeeding in the usual line to the office of family
hard, happened to have no talents for original composition,
he was nevertheless bound by his situation, to leam, and
to transmit, to his heir in office, the best compositions of
the bards who went before him.

Those men are much mistaken who believe that neither
kindness nor hospitality, disinterested magnanimity, gene-
rosity of heart, nor sympathy of soul, were conspicuous
among the F e'inne : that neither the knowledge nor practice
of virtue existed in their times ; but that these have lately
been introduced into our country.

n direct opposition to such conjectures, we can easily
prove, that the noblest virtues have been ruined, or driven
into exile, since the love os money has crept in amongst
us 3 and since deceit and hypocrisy have carried mercenary
policy and slavish‚ sordid avarice into our land. Before
this modern change, our chiefs cherished humanity. They
were warm-hearted, determined, and immoxfeabie, in sup-
porting their friends, and always proved the shield and
shelter of th‘e— feeble„ gf hey possessed elevation of senti-
ment, an independent'spirit, and unshaken fortitude, which
were the defence of their friends, and the destruction of
their own enemies, and the enemies of their country.
