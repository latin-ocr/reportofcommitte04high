ment of the Consular Government (A. A. C. 505.) So late
,even as the year 260 before the Christian era, wnen the
Columna rostrata was erected, the Roman language, as ap..
pears from the inscription upon it (Graev. Thesaur. Ant.
Rom. Tom. IV. p. 1810.) differed widely from what it
was afterwards in the age of Julius Caesar. Audit de-
serves our special not‘oee that its ablative case bears the ge->
nuine Celtic form÷PucnandorL Praedad‚ instead of Pug-
nando, Praeda. ,It is also a singular coincidence that alae-
though the Gaelic orthography has hitherto preserved the
concluding d, it is never sounded--Cogadh‚ creachadh‚ be-
ing ¹universally pronounced Coga, creacha. And it may
be remarked, that the more ancient form of the Latin geni-
tive of the first declension—-Aulai, Pennai—is purely Gae-
lic; the genitive case of Mala, Fion-na, being Malai,
F ionnai. ⁹

As the Romans were gradually extending their dominion
over the states of Italy, and uniting themselves with its se-
veral nations, they'seem (Quintil. L. I. c. 9.) to have
adopted more or less of the language of each. And as an-
cient authors (Herodot. Dionys. Halicarnass. Plin. Flor-
Tacst.) inform us, that Cehs, Siculi or Sicani, Lydians or
Tyrrheni, Pelasgi, and Greeks of various denomination,
were established there before the Roman state was founded,
so, the accuracy of history, in recording this mixture of-
race, is proved by the mixt aspect of the Latin language3
which was formed, in process of time, from many discord-
ant tongues into an harmonious and comprehensive whole.
For its groundwork is acknowlerdged to be the Greek of
Eolia, (from which ,the primitive Romans should seem to
have sprung,) into whose polished form the m'ilitude of
Celtic and Oriental roots are so completely mouldcd, that it
requires a c1itical eye to distihg'uish them. Ῥωμὸῑωι δὲ φωνήν
