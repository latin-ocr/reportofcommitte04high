Trian do mhaithibh Innsefizil.

TRANSLATION.

The hosts offered 311 advice

To the great Manes of successful ships,

To trace back their way upon ocean,

To meet the chiefs of the host of Inisphail.

So the heroes returned by their fifties fleme,

And loud was their noise on the strand.

Like a roaring wave each band advanced-

Fingal immediately dispatched 3 messenget

To Manes of the victorious pursuits and exploitaj:

‘⁶ WVhere are thy solemn oaths,

:³:32

Thou man that upholdest saith but with thy left hand ξ

Fierce and. furious &newered the chief,
With the wouted frown of his wrath,
ό(Ἰ left them on the dew of the grass,
