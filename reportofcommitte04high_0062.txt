44· REPORT oN THE

DEAR S1R, Kincardine‚ 4th March 1801.

Ihave‚ as far as my judgment and
recolleffion served me, made a communication to
the Highland Society concerning Ossian's poems. A
certain conjeSture of amine I venture to bring under
your view and Mr Charles M‘Intosh’s‚ to be dispos-
ed of as your judgment will dire& I remember
Mr Macpherson reading the MSS. found in Clan-
ronald's, execrating the bard who di&ated to the
amanuenfis‚ saying‚ ⁶ D-——n the scoundrel, it is
he himself that now speaks, and not Offian.’ This
took place in my house, in two or three instances z
Ι thence conjefiture that the MSS. were kept up, lest
they should fall under the view of such as would be
more ready to publish their deformities than to point

out their beauties.
It was, and I believe still is well known, that the

broken poems of Offian, handed down from one
generation to another, got corrupted. In the state

of the Highlands‚ and its language, this evil, Ι ap.
prehend‚ could not be avoided3 and I think great
creditis due, in such a case, to him who restores a

work of merit to its original purity.⁴
