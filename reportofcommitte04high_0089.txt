by Mr M‘Diarmid‚ the Committee subjoins here, with
Maepherson’s transsation of the samepaffages at the

‘ Waem, April 9th‚ 1801.

‘ Inclosed you have a transsation of the Gaelic
pieces which I sent you last week. It is as literal as
poffible. Imade it so 01} purpose, without any re-
gard to the English idiom, that you might under-
stand the original the better. Every one knows at
what disadvantage a transsation of this kind must ap2
pear9 from one language into another, but more
especially when the idioms and genius of the two
languages differ so widely as those of the Gaelic and
Engliffi. As Ι have not a copy of Mr Maepherfon's
transsation by me, Icould not compare it with the
original, nor point out wherein he has departod from
it; ΜΓ Mackenzie will eafily see that, by compar-
ing his transsation with mine. I got the'copy-of these
peetus, about thirty years ago, from an old man in Glen-
lyon. Itook it, and several other fragments, now
I fear irrecoverably lost, from the man’s mouth.
He had learnt them ln his youth, from people in the
same glen, which must have been long before Mac-
pherson was born. I had at one time a confiderable
number of old poems, some of them part of what
Macpherson has transsated3 but by lending them
from hand to hand, I cannot now poffibly trace
