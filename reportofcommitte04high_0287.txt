oF THE onmmAL. 113
WVhen Meyvv found herself rejected

In the esteem of the hero of untainted character,
She devised to wound his body,
Because he would hot partake in her guile.

F or him she laid tlie snare of death,
Because he did not comply with a woman’s wishes 3
Sad was the destroying of him by a monster,
In the manner which I ncf'w shall mndidly tell.

On the lake of Meyv was a mountain ash,
Where southward spreads the shore,
And during each month of the sea'fton
Its fruit was seen to be ripe.

Such was the virtue of its clusters
That sweeter it was than the hone'y of ffowerfi,
And the reddened fruit would support
A person deprived of food for three days:

A year to the life of man,
It is certain that it would add,
And the diseased derived relief

From the juice of its tipened berry.

But danger hung on the pursuit of it,

For, though it proved a cure to the people,
Α, venomous monster lurked at its root

To prevent all from approaching to pluck if.

Grievous sickness seized
The daughter of Omhach of the genereus cups ε
