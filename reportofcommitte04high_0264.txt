mor the desire to enquire into the matter. But -I consider
the combatants in the dispute in the same light with the “
two knights who fought about the shield hung between
them; the one maintaining it was white, the other it was
black‚ while each looked only on the side that was next
him3 so that both were partly in the right, and partly
in the wrong. That Fingal fought, and that Ossian
sung, cannot be doubted. That the poems of Ossian
extended their fame for ages over Britain and Ireland‚
is also clear from Barbour, Cambden, Colgan, and many
other old writers of the ⁴three kingdoms. That at least
the stamina, the bones, sinews, and strength, of a great
part of the poems now *ascribed to him are ancient, may
I think be maintained on many good grounds. But that
some things modern may have been superinduced, will,
if not allowed, be at least believed on grounds of much
probability: and to separate precisely the one from the
other, is more than the translator himself, were he alive,
could now do, if he had not begnn to do so from the
beginning. Even then he might not be sure of the ge-
nuineness of every poem *or passage given him as an-
cient, supposing his own invention were out of the que-
stion. What cannot therefore be determined otherwise,
,tntut in the end be compromised. I suspect the ori-²
gineis, if published‚ (as I imagine they are not likely
to bc,) were never intended to decide the question about
their anthenticity, but perhaps to render it problematical
¹or suspicions. ι
