22 LETTERS 'ro nn. BLAIR

they are of that kind that Mr Macphmson, I think judici..
ously rejects, as Irish imitations of the works of Ossian.
vO1'1e Augus Fletcher, a sherriff-officer, was here about two
days ago at my desire, he can repeat many of 111656 poems,
but none of those Mr Macpherson has translated, except a
part of the poem entitled, the Battle of Lora, and that
*very much corrupted. But from my own memory, I can
assure you, that Morla's proposal to Cuchullin, Fingal',
b. ii. p. 26, with Cuchullin's answer, and Morla’s reply,
is a 111511131151311011. So is the whole episode of Borbar
and Faineasolis, Fingal, b. iii. p. 45 and 46, and Fingal,
b. iv. p. 57 and 58, from‘ “ we reared the sun beams,”
&c- to “ now like a hundred different winds. ” Ι can
still repeat some of these in the original. The whole
poem of Dar-thula I have frequently'heard, but I remem-
ber no part of it. All these, and many more, I heard 111 ’
the Island of Sky, when I was a little boy, from an old
man who used to repeat thern to me for some tobacco, which
I procured him as often as I wanted to hear them. This
man died when I was but very young, and I could never
since meet with any person that could repeat so many of
the poems of Osslian, or so perfectly. I am sorry I cannot
give you or the public any more satisfaction on this point.
Had such an enquiry been made fifty years sooner, Iam
persuaded hundreds could attest that Mr Macpherson’s
zranslations are really what they pretend to be. With
sincere 65166111, Ι 3111 ”
’ Your affectionate brother, and
most humble servant,
