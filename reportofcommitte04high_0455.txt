LETTER FROM LORD BANNATYNE, ETC. 281

the largest and most valuable collection of Gaelic mum..
scripts now remaining in the Highlands of Scotland.

The public are no strangers to the desire with which the

of whatever respected the history and antiquities of this
country. The course of my duty, while I was Sheriff of

M‘Pherson, containing portions of poetry mixed with other
