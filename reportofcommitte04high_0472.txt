The fourth and last MS. of this Collection that has been
received by the Society consists of various Tales and Poems,
ancient and modern. The authors of them are noi 'men-⁴-
tioned3 but one of the Poems is ascribed by an older MS.
(that of the Dean of Lismore) to Conal son of Edirskeol'.
The-Poem that seems to be the best, is a very pathetic one
which was composed on occasion of Archibald Earl of

Argyll being imprisoned in the Castle of Edinburgh about

the year 1680.

This MS. was written at Aird-Chonail upon Lochowe
in the years 1690 and 1691, by Ewan Mac Lean for Colin
Campbell, as several dates upon it bear3 one of which,
taken from the first page of its 79th leaf, is as follows:

EOGAN MAG GHILLEOIN-—Le mo laimh do eriochnuidh
in eaehdrasa cla sgriobhadh in seaehdmadh la don mhios
Mhairt aon 11111116 se ced aondeg eeithre fithid dannaladh

ar ttighearna Iosa Criosd.
Caillain Caimpbel leis in leis in leabharan .1. Gaillain
mac Dhonchai mhic Dhughil mhic Chaissain oig. ⁵

The meaning of which is this:

EWAN MAC LEAN--By my hand was finished the wri0
'ting οἱ this story the seventeenth day of the month 'of
March, one thousand six hundred ninety and one of the era

of our Lord Jesus Christ:⁰
Colin Campbell is the owner of this book, namely, Colin,

,son of Dunean, son of Dougal‚ son of Colin the younger·

 

The next Manuscript to be noticed was given to the
Society by Lord Bannatyn'e. It bears no date in its text3
