⁶ Know γε a short tale of Fingal !
A tale that claims your attention.
It concerns the son of Cornhal of powerful sway 3
whom, while I live, I [hall in woe relnember.
We were few in his train,
By the fall of Ruya, that softly mmmurs,
XVhen we saw a large sailed boat afar,
Which conveyed a fair over ocean.
Fifty alert heroes sat around the king 3
Trusty were their deeds in support of right.

How unlike, alas l are they whom I behold in your stead2

O ye, whose strength could controul each land ξ
We all stood up in haste,
Except Fingal himself, and Gaul,
To wait on the high bounding boat,
VVhose course was parting the waves.
It neither ssackened nor rested,
Till it entered our wonted haven,
It cross'ed the pool below the fall,
When out of ilt rose a daughter of youth.
Brighter she [hone than a boam of the sun 3
Her air and manner ,exceeded her form.
In presence of the fair, who came from afar3
We all respeffful stood.
She proceeds to the tent of Fingal,
And greets him in mufical accent-
The son of Comhal made suitable reply,
