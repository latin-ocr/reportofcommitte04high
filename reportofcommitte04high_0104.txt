86 REPORT ON THE

itself belng published‚ in which his evidence is con-
tained3 and how much soever many of the letter-s
may seem to be a mere repetition of others, or to
contain no evidence whatever, their publication is
not the less necessary, as negative evidence with re-

Among the letters which I have seen, there is one
from Mr Anderson of the Dell of Kinguffie, or
King's Huntley, intimating‚ in answer to the inqui-
ries of the Highland Society, that he had a book in
his poffession‚ containing Mr Macpherson’s first es·-
says in English poetry‚ which he did not choose‚ or
conceive himself at liberty to rescue from that obli-
vion to which the author seemed to have configned
it. Now my Lord, whether this MS. volume be
Macpherson²s poetical common-place book, con-
taining those claflical quotations which he transfer-
red to his Offian‚ or whether it contain his original
English poetry, such important evidence ought not=
to be suppress'ed. Nothing has appeared more satis-
fa&ory to impartial men, unconnecled with the
Highlands‚ than th‘e discovery of a prior epic poem
by Macpheffon, containing the same sentiments‚ ima-
geryJ and expreflions with his Oflian3 and as the
same resemblance may be traced in his lesser poems,
lately published from the Scots Magazine‚ I am
entitled to conclude, that those first effays of his
muse in English, if fairly produced, would afford
the same convincing detections of Offian. It is in
vain to say that Mr Anderson is *not at liberty to

produce
