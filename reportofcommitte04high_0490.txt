All the Gaelic MSS. in the possession of the Society
written from the earliest period till after the 18th century
(with the single exception of the Dean of Lismore's vo-
lume) are written in the very ancient form of character
which was common of old to Britain and I'reland1, and
which was adopted by the Saxons at the time of their con-'
version. For the'lastvforty years it seems to have been dis-
continued in Scotland3 the last specimen which the Society
have received of it, being a.volume of Songs, in which is
included one of Duncan 'Macintyre’s‚-entitled‚ Aa T aileir
Mac Neachdain, which he composed in 1752, between
which and the year 1768, it is probahle that the volume in
question was written, because the first edition of Macin-
tyre⁹s Songs was published in· that year. ⁴

A Deed of Fosterage in this collection between Sir Nor-2
man Macleod and John Mackenzie executed in the year
1645 shows that the Gaelic language was not disused in
legal obligations at that period.
