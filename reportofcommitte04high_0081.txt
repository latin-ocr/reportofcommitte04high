POEMS OF OSSIAN. 623

As I am, without a person to share my fondness.
Spare them, fince there is not a hero to view
The blue flame of the beautiful torches.

Caothan of the joyful lights,

Thy torches are now darkened ;

Like an oak which has quiekly faded,

Thy dwellings and their people have failed.
East or west, on the face of thy mountain,
There is not found of one of them but the ruin.
In Scallama ἦε, in Tauro, 01· ‘I‘zgth-mor-r2'*,
There is no iheu, nor song, nor harp3
They are all become green mounds‚
And their stones in their own meadows.
The stranger will not perceive from the desart
Any one of them shewing its head through the cioud.
And thou Seallama, house of my delight!
Is this heap thine old ruin ?
Where now grows the thistle, the heath, and the rank grass.
Mourning under the drop of night.--
Around my grey locks
The solitary owl ssutterS,
And the roe starts from her bed,
Without fearing the mournful Offian.
Roe of the hollow Cairns †,
Where dwelt Oscar and Fion ‡‚
I will not do thee any hurt 3
Never (halt thou be wounded by my dart.—
To the top of Seallama I stretch my hand 3
The dwelling has no cover but [ky.
I search for the broad {hiel'd below ;
The top of my spear has struck its bost.—

Sounding
