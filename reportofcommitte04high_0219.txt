pressions must have ceased to form a part of our mugire,
were they not found in the poems of Ossian, and illustrat-
ed or quoted by other bards and aged men? who frequent-
ly allude to them.

Though we do not find these poems to cor-respond pre-
cisely in every expression over all the Highlands and
Isles‚ when repeated by different persons, they all corre-
spond in substance3 and there is not one instance, in any
corner of this country, in which one poem is found con-
trary to the rest, or in opposition to their general character.
And though it were attempted to make the ablest scholar
translate these poems into English, or any other mugire,
he surely could not transfuse into them the merits of the
original3 but still less could he (as is alledged) first com->
pose them in English, and then turn<them into such Gae-
lic as should retain the bone and marrow of their own true·
language. ’

Let the opponents of Ossian then point out to us poetx‘y
of equal merit with his, composed in any languagc‚ not:¹
an original one, and in a fictitious one, and referring to a
nation and a history altogether fabulous. I suspect they
would expose themselves tovridicule by the attempt. lWany
poets after Ossian endeavoured to copy or to imitate him {⁷
but there is no man that understands our tongue‚ or the
nature of ourypoetry, but will, on the first hearing of the—
first verses, easily distinguish their poems from his.

He mentions some poets who lived before him, and who
sung the exploits of the heroes os their age: he himself⁷
in like manner, sings the deeds of the Faeinne, as he had
heard or witnessed them in his earlier years. He was suc--
ceeded by other bards, who transmitted the history ancl
poetry of their countrymen from generation to generation.
The chieftains‚ and men of influence in the Highlands‚
rewarded and supported those bards, who not only com-
posed original poems, but also recited the compositions οἱ
