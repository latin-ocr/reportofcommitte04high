ln ἐι preface prefixed to this publication, Maepherson
{tnnounced that there was a great deal of poetry of the
same kind still to be found in the Highlands and Islands 3
and,- in particular, that there was one work, of consider-
able length, which dese‘rved to be stiled an Heroic Poeni,
which might be 'recovered and translated, if encourage-
ment was given to such an undertaking. A subscription
was immediately set about in the Parliament-House, and
a surh sufficient to mss‘ke such an important search was soon
collected. Mr Maepherso‘n made two journies through the
Highlands, on one of which ΜΓ Home accompanied him,
and the result was, the publication at London first of Fin„

As, before this accidental rne'eting with ΜΓ Home, ΜΓ
Maepherson had no idea of collecting and translating the
works of Ossian, the fact remained on my mind as a

Ossian, when both the interna] and external evidence was
So ably scrutinized by the late Dr Blair. Upon this
ground, I remain fully convinced that Maepherson did not,
and could not, with all his abilsty,= which was great, fabri-
cate the poems;v though I am ready to admit, that aster
collecting an the scattered fragmentS, he tied them together
in form of heroic poems, ‘as Homer is said to have done
When he collected the songs of the bards of Greece.

Maepherson however had laid himself too much open to
the critic's by attempting‚ in his Dissertations on Fingal,
to unite two things that must ever remain separate, viz,
poetical fiction and historical truth‚ which Ι observe has
opened a late violent attack on him, by a writer of history,
which I have little doubt will prove as ineffectual to over-
throw the authenticity of Ossian, as any of the former
attacks.

I have only to add, that during my intimacy with M acm
*pherson for two winters in London, in 1769 and 70, when
