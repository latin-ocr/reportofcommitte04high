The discrepancies which are found between the two
collectione, and the circumstance of parallel passages
sometimes occurring in poems bearing a different
title in Smith’s to that affigned them by Kennedy,⁴
seem to the Committee to afford a'n argument rather¹
sor than against their authenticity‚ especially when*
the manner of obtaining those poenis, from the re*

One of the poenis collected by Kennedy, entitled
Carril‚ the Committee has never seen any where else.
‘fhough with a fimplicity bordering· on rudeness‚ it
is extremely striking in the Gaelic, but very difficule
to be transsated. It is given entire in the Appendbc,
No, 2⁶2. in Kennedy’s own orthography‚ and with·
it the preamble or argument with which he accom*

form an opinion of the collection 3 from the second.
the English reader may estimate the litei-ary abilities
of the collector.

The Committee cannot in this place avoid remark-

to this subject, that the collectione of the ancient(or

tlte reader pieces of such uncommon poetical merit.
