ority over all bards was never called in question, were their
peculiar care.

Hence we are under some obligations to Maepherson,
whose industry, at a very critical period, has saved some of
the poems of Ossian, which must otherwise have probably
perished. The race of our bards is, however, eminet,
and much of our poetry is lost, though a great deal still

We have certain evidence of the fact, that bards were
