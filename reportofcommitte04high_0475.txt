Lovely land is that eastern land4
Albion with all its lakes,
ᾗ O that Ι might not depart from it. ¹
But Ι depart with Naos.
Lov ely 13 the tower of Fidga, and the tower of Fingal.
Lovely ls the tower above thern.
*Lovely the isle of Drayno,
And lovely the tower of Suvn0.
But, alas ἔ the wood‚ the hay, which Ainle would
. ᾖ approach, ⁴
Are left by me and N aos for ever
Upon the coast of Albion.
O vale of Laith! would I were sleeping by its soothing
murmur Σ
F ish and venison‚ and the choice of the chace prepared,
Would be my repast in Glenlaith.
Glenmasain! high grow its herbs, fair wave its branches,
Steep would be the place of our repose ,
Ov er the grassy banks of Masan.
O vale of Etha! where a first house has been built for me,
Delightful were its groves, when the sun risen to his
would strike his beams on Gleneiti. [heiglgp
. How Ι long for the vale of Urchay Σ
Straight vale of the fairest hills;
Joyful were his companions around Naos
In Glenurchay.
Vale of Damadh!
Pleasant to me would be each of its people:
Sweet is the note of the cuckoo
From the bending tree of the mountain
Above Glen-da-Ruadh.
Lovely is Drayno of the sounding shore!
Lovely is Avich of the brightest sand!
O! that I might not depart from it west.
Β But 1 depart with my love !
