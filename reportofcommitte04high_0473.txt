'but the ‘cover of it has the following date in a modern
hand, though black letter. ‘⁶ Gleann Masain an cuige la
deag do an . . . Mh : : : do bhlian ar tsaoirse Mile da chead‚

trichid sa hocht.'’ That is, Glen Masan, the 15th day of l

the . . . of M ::: of the year of our Redemption 1238.
The date being so particular, must be thought to have been
taken from the MS. itself when it was more entire than it
is now, for it is greatly mutilated. Ἰ Glenmasan‚ where it was
written, is a valley in the districtos Cowal, which, with
Glenurchay and Gleneiti, two other vales of Argyllshire‚
is celebrated in the passage to be presently quoted from it,
as the scene in which the sons of Usnoth followed the
chace.

It {appears from a note on the margin of its 15th1eaf‚
that it formerly belonged to *she Rev. William Campbell,
minister of Kilchrenan and Dalavich‚ who was a native of
Cowal, and to whom it may perhaps have descended from
his grand uncle Mr. Robert Campbell in Cowal, an accom-
plished scholar and poet, who wrote the eighth address pre-
fixed to the Archaeologia of Mt. Edward L'nuyd.

It consists of some mutilated tales in prose, interspersed
with verse. One of them regards the tragical story of
Deardiu, Dearduil‚ or Darth'ula‚ and the three sons of
Usnoth‚ Natos, Ainle, and Ardan, from which the following
extract is made, and asae simile exhibited in Plate HI.
No. 4. down to the eighth line of the vase, to enable such
as are curious on Vthis head to form a judgment of the age
of the MS. ⁷ ’
