152· REPoRT ON ΤΗΕ

Mr Macpherson obtained in the form in which he
has given it to the world. The poenis and frag»-
ments of poems which the Committee has been able
to procure, contajn, as will appear from the article
in the* Appendix, „N0. 15. already mentioned, often
the substance, and sometimes almost the literal ex-
'preffion (the‘ipsissz'ma verba), of paffages given by
ΜΓ Macpherson, in the poems of which he has pub-
§ished vthe transsations. But the Committee has not
been able to obtain any one poem the same in title
and tenor with the poenis publiihed by him. It is
inclined to believe that he was in use to supply
(thasius, and to give conneffion, by inserting pas-
sages which he did not find, and to add what he
conceived to be dignity and delicacy to the original
composition, by striking out paffageS, by sostening
incidente, by refining the language, in {hort by
‹zhanging what he confidered as too snnple or too
rude fora modern ear, and elevating ‘what in his
opinion was below the standard of good poetry.
To what degree, however, he exercised these liber-
ties, it is impoffible for the Committee to determine.
The advantages he poffefl'ed, which the Committee
began its inquiries too late to enjoy, of colleffing
from the oral recitation of a number of persone·
now no more, a very great number of the same
poenis, on t'ne same subjefi'ffi, and then collating
those different copies or editions, if they may be so
called, reje&ing what was spurious or corrupted in
one copy, and adopting from another something'
more. {termine and excelienz in its piace, afforded
