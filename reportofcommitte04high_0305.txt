Stanza 7. “ 'Noavil sl'm binnan e s mac Cubhail
¹ ‘⁶ An riogh siuji bha air na Fiannibh
‘⁶ Dhefheudadh fir an domhain
“¹ Do} na Thallamhsan gun iaruidh.’'

There is no word' m ehe Gaelic language that bears the
most distant likeness to ’Noavil‚ which begins this quota*
tion. It is to be presumed from the En< lish that ls given
for i t, Dost thou imagines that the translator readj or took itg
for An Saoil. And if we read it So, the litera] translation
of t-he passage is as follows—

Dost thou imagine thar. he was equa-‘l to the son of
Comhal ?
That king who was over the' heroes of F ingalss
All the men of the world might enter
Into his hall unbidden. ἢ

Instead of which it is thus rendered in the version of
Mr. Hill-“ Dost thou imagine that he is' equal to the son*
‘⁶ of Comhal ἒ that king who ruled over the nations, who
“ defeated ΕΠ the peopbz of the earthj and visi-ted their
“f kingdoms unse'nt for.'’

There seems but one way 03f ac‘cou‘nting for so singular a
translation of a very plain passage. Mr. Hill had observet}
(p. 10².)7 that he was “ inclined to su⁵specfi that there are in
aa the song of Det-mid killing the wild Boura, some words di„
“ rectly derived from the English,· as Bheisu thri, &c.”
It did not, perhaps‚· occur to him that the Gaelic beist and:

in which they were known for a whole millenniutm and we

know not how much lofigen before the English languagep,
