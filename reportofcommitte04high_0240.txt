3. From the Rev‘. Dr. CARLYLE, to WM M’DONALD,
ESQ Secretary to the Highland Society, dated Mussel-
burgh, 9th January 1802.

DEAR Sm,

An accident-has brought to my remem--
brance an engagement I made to you many months ago,
which I now shall endeavour to fulfil. The subject may
not be important, but the age of the witness admonishes
him to give his evidence without loss of time.

On the 2d day of October 1759, (I happen to know the
date exacdy), I came from the neighbourhood of Dumfries
to Moffat in the morning, and ‘finding John Home, the<
author of Doughs, there, I resolved tobstay all day with
him. In the course of our conversation, he told me that.
he had at last fiound what he had been long wishing for,
a person who could make him a'cquainted with ancient
Highland poetry‚ of which he had. heard so much. This
was james Macpherson, who was then tutor to Μι- Gra-
ham of Balgowan, whom he had, with much· solicitation
and difficulty, prevailed with tov translate some specimens
of that poetry which he had by beart, but which, he said,
he could not do justice to in an English translation. ΜΓ
Home had been highly delighted with them ;¹ and when he
showed them to me, I was perfectly astonished at the· poe-
tical genius displayed in them. W'e agreed that it was a‘
precious discovery, and that as soon as possible it should-
be published to the world. Μι- Home carried the manu-
script with him soon after to Edinburgh3 and having
shows. it to Dr Blair‚. and other good judges, they were·
so miio‘w pleased that they encouraged Mt· Maepherson to
publish them without delay, which he did early in the
year 1760, with the title of Fragments of Ancient Poetry·
collect.d in the Highlauds.
