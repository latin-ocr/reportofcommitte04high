POEMS oF ossum. 51

‘ Offian and the G‹lerk‚' sometimes called ⁶ the
Battle of Fingal and Manus ;' ‘ Mar mharbh Diar-
mad

Thus, in p. 13. l. 47. of Ossz'an agus an Cla-ich,

⁴ Mi sein, agus m'athair, is Goll,
Triur bo mho glonn san fhein‚'

is rendered in the transsation given by Mr Hill, '

‘ Myself, my father and Gaul, were those
Who had most children amongst our heroes ;'

instead of the true meaning,

‘ Myself, my father and Gaul, were the three
Of greatest prowess among the heroes?

And again, p. 22. second stanza of Urm‘gh Ossz'an, ‘ Oifhein nan
Glonn' is transsated ‘ O! Offian of many children,’ instead of
‘ O Ξ Offian of the deeds of prowess.' From which paffages Mr
Hill is led to remark, ‘ that being the father of many children is
ever accounted a great honour among barbariansss

At page 24, stanza 18,

‘ Sgan a chreideas me do sgeul

A cleirich led leabhar ban
Gum bithidh Fionn na chomh fhiaL
Aig duine no aig Dia an laimh.'

Thus Englished in the transsation of Mr Hill ε

‘ Ι can hardly believe thy tale, thou light-haired and unworthy·
clerk ! that the heroes of our race should be in captivity either to
the devil or to God.’
