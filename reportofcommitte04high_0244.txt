I ΗΑΒ the honour of your letter of the 315t
ult. with the printed quel-ies circulated by the Highland
Society of scotland relative to Ossian's poems. On the
subject of these queriesz I advanced all I had to say long
ago 3 and if any thing fell in my way since, pro or con, it
was allowed to pass unnoticed, as I never intended to be-
stow any further thoughts upon the matter. If, however3
upon recollection‚ any thing* new, or more explicit, shall
occur m my memor-y? I shall state it5 but cannot help
thinking, with all due deference to better judges, that the
t'i1·1ve:stiga‘tion¹ set on foot by the Society, would do better
after the poems should have been first published‚ and al -
{owed to speak, at least in part, for themselves.
