60 REPORT ON THE

self, has annexed to his publication. (Vide Dr
Smith’s Differtation‚ p. 128.) A more particular
one the Committee wished to receive from him-
self3 but he frankly told its Chairman, that he
had been so much disgusted with the reception of
his book, as to have long banished the remem-
brance from his mind; and that he had not even
kept a copy for his own use, to which he might
refer for an answer to his queries. Dr Smith's let-
ters to Mr Mackenzie‚ however, contain so much
good sense, and so much rational remark on the
subject of the Committee's inquiries, that it is tempt-
ed to annex them entire to this Report, (Appendix‚
ΝΟ. 5.) One passage the Committee will quote
here, as affording a strong proof of the Doctor's
fairness and candour. He ἧψε, ‘ that on his ob-
serving in one of the poema one or two passages
which he thought of uncommon beauty‚ the person,
who gave it as ancient said he had composed those* pas-
sages himself ; that he, Dr Smith, imputed this ·at
the time to the man's vanity3 but that he thought it
right to state it to the Committee.’ Whether such
person might compose one or two paffages in those
poems, the Committee will not pretend to decide ;
but when one looks over the list of those from whom
the Doc'tOr collected his originals, and considers
their rank and situation in life, their education and
opportunities of improvement, to believe that they
could compose such poems would be a degree of
credulity much greater than is neceffary to believe
in the authenticity of Offian.
