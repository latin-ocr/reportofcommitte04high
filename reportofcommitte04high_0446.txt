272 FLETCHER'S

Breadalbane‚ Perthshire, from whom he got a written copy
of it. He declares, That the song called Losga Tigh Fara-
birne no Farmail, he heard recited by many people in the
country above fifty years ago, and ns far back as he can
remember any thing, and he is sure he heard it before
M‘Pherson went about to collect the Poems of Ossian in
the country ofssGlenor-chay: That he learnt this poem some
time ago from Janet M‘Kenrick or Henderson, now re-
siding in Glenfalloch, and that she got it from the said
M‘Nicols of Arivean. He further declares, the song or
poem called Duan a Ghairbh mhic Stairn he heard recited
in the country by many persons above forty years ago, and
particularly by Finlay M‘Kenrick or Henderson, in
Croitandeor in Gle'ndochart in Perthshire, a very old man,
from whom or from John M‘Kenrick his uncle in Glen-
orchay, the said Finlay learnt the song, and that some time
ago, the declarant himself learnt this song by heart from
John M‘Intyre in Stronmialachan in Glenorchay, a man
of about sixty years of age, who had it from Duncan M‘In-
tyre who resided near Bunaw, Argyleshire: Declares, That
he is certain he heard the song of Garbh mac Stairn recited
'by many persons as above, long before M‘Pherson went
about collecting the Poems of Ossian. Declares, That the
song called Eachdraidh air Conachar Righ Erin agus truir
mhac Righ Bharrachoil, an edition of which M‘Pherson
has published under the name of Darthula, and which is
commonly called in the country, Clann Uisneachain, or the
Sons of Usno, he heard recited above fifty years ago by
many persons in Glenorchay, particularly by Nicol M‘Ni-
col in Arivean, who resided some time in Achaladar, and
this he thinks, was about ten years before M‘Pherson went
about collecting the Poems of Ossian. Doelares, That in
the collection which he has now deposited with the Society,
there are several other poems, some of 'which relating to
the actions of the race of Fingal, he likewise heard recited
