THE DEATH oF CARILL.

Marking all their paths with slaughter.

“ Tem-ful, doleful, is the strain of the Fingalians5
Deploring the mighty warrior of pleasant smile;
Mournful, sad, does F ingal lanient thee
Who shalt be seen no longer in the hall of heroes Ξ

“ Unfortunate was the death of the valiant cham-

pion, .
Who fell without war, in a duel.
Like a cloud of night he departed from us ;

Sad is the tale we are left to mourn !
‘⁶ The maids of Sora will raise the strain of woe,

On account of the fair and lovely youth ;

As the mountain mist is each tendet fair,

Dropping mars, as she wails with stifled voice.
“ The hero, vigorous, strong and tall,

Is now without motion, arms, or dress.

Narrow and level is the place of thy repose‚

On the margin of the meadow--Great is our wound of
woe Ξ
“ Upon the pebbly strand thou didst constantly move,
On the boister0us‚ white-foaming ocean ς
Musical, melodious in the field,
In the time of hunting the full grown deer.
“ O! hero mild, chearful, beloved,
Eloquent, vigorous, active, expert to wound ς
Like a strong stream amongst enemies,--
Farewell, beloved of the sharp blades !'’,
