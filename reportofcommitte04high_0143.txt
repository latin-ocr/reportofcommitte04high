POEMS OF ossiAN. ’1 ·

They proceeded to fight with the guaz'ne‘ dart,-
‘With unabated eagerness and hzuffihood,
Till the gracefffl youth received a wound
From the nurseling of hard fought battles.
He fell, like a tree of flourishing g'rowth‚
In the wilderness of pines, unexpefkedly.
The rock from which it sprung resounds to its fau:
Its bank of earth stlakes, and bursts asunder.
“ O son of youth, who hast come from a foreign land ἶ
By me has thy wound been given.
Soon {hall thy stone be exahed.
Do not conceal from us for ever who thou art,
Tess me now, without resen-e,
· Since fate has met thee in my field of battle,
Who thou ιιι-τις, and what thy name,
And from 'what quarter thou hast come.”
“ Alas! that thou didst fail to know me,
My noble, high-minded, beloved father!
WNheu my dart, with fideway aim and fceffle casis?
Sought thee with averted barb.’'

The Societ'y must no't however judge of the force
and beauty of this poem by the transsation here giv-
en of it. There is, in the original Gaelic‚ particu= v
larly in the description of the combat of the heroes,
by means of the succeffive swess of epithets‚ the ap-
propriate terms of fimplicity and force by which the
affion is brought before the eye, and the rapid move-*2
ment of the measure ‘which gives it to the ear, alto='
gether an effe& produced, to. which no combination
of words in the English language, which the Com·
mittee could either command or procare, can at all
do justice.
