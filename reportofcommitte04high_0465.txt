‘The‘ Critic-ai Exposition prefixed to the Tain, gives a
brief account of it in the technical terms of the' Scots
literature of the remote age in which it was written.
‘⁶ Ceathardha connagur in each ealathuin is cuincda don
tsairsisi na Tana. Loc di cedumus lighe Fercusa mhic
Roich ait in rou hathnachd four mach Nai. Tempus

That is-—The four things which'are requisite to be
known in every regular'composition are to be noticed in this
work of the Tain. The PLAcE of its origin is the stone of
F ergus son of Roich‚ where he was buried on the plain of
Nai. The TIME of it, besides, is that in which Diarmad
son of Cervail, reigned over Ireland. The AUTnoR, too, is
F erg-us son of Roich3 for he it was that prompted it forth-
with to the bat-ds. The CAUSE of writing it was avisit
which Shenachan Torbda with three chief bards made to
Guaire King of Connacht.

The subject and character of this TAIN bho Cuailgne is
concisely and justly expressed by Roderic O Flaherty.
‘4 Fergnsius Rogius solo pariter ac solio Ultoniae exter-
minatus, in Corinactiam ad Ollilum et Maudam ibidem reg-
nantes profugit3 quibus patrocinantibus, memorabile exar-
eit bellum septannale inter Connactios et Ultonios multis
poeticis figmentis, ut ea ferebat aetas, adornatum. Hujus
belli circiter medium, octennio ante caput aerae Christianae,
Mauda regina Connacfiae, Fergusio Rogio ductore, im-
mensam boum praedam conspicuis agentium et insectantium
virtutibus memorabilem, e Cualgnio in agro Louthiimo re«
portavit *3’
