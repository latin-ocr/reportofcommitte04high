90 REPORT ON ΤΗΒ

The MSS. which the Committee obtained from the
other correspondents above alluded to, were various
copies or editions (as they may be called) of the
poems of Offian, or poems in imitation of Offian,
now in most common circulation in the Highlands.
They were chiefly colleeoed in the Western High-
lands and issands, and frequently appeared to be the
same poems, but in some of the copies with confi-
derable variations‚ and what appeared to be corrup-
tions, with those current in Ireland 3 some of which
Miss Brooke, the lady herein before mentioned,
publifhed, with a metrical transsation. A good
many pieces‚ seemingly of a purer sort, though al·
ways with a mixture of rude, and sometimes unin-
telligible paffages, were sent to the Society by Mr
M‘Laggan‚ minister of Blair in Athole‚ Sir George
Maekenzie of Coull, and Sir J. Sinclair‚ Barts.;
the Reverend Mr Sage of Kildonnan, in Sutherland‚

bald Fletcher '¹‘ in Achalladar, Glenmchy, Mr Peter
M‘Farlane of Perth‚ the Reverend Mr Malcolm

of Brackish, and the Reverend ΜΓ Stewart‚ minister
