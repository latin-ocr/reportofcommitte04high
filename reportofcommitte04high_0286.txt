3. LITERAL TRANSLATION 01⁴· THE ORIGINALs

THE sigh of a friend in the grove of Fraoch 2
A sigh for the hero in it⁷s rounded pale,
A sigh which causes each man to mcum,
And which makes each maiden weep l,

There, to the westwa'1·d‚ is the Carn ᾖ,
Which covers Fraoch, son of Fiach, os the soft hairs
He who obeyed the call of Mey,

And from whom that Cam of Fraoch has its name.

The maid-5 from Cruchan weep,
Sad is the cause of their woe‚
For their mournful sighs are occasioned,
By Fraoffl, son of Fiach, of the ancient weapons.

Him most bewails the maid
Who comes to weep in the grove of Fraoch,
The brown-eyed fair of curling locks,
Only daughter of Meyv, whom the heroes obey.

Only daughter of Corul of finest hair,
Vshose side to night is stretched by the side of Fraoch,
Though many were the men who sought her love,
She Ioved none but Fraoch.
