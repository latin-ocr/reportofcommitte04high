-WAS intimately acquainted with Mr. James Maephen
son’s abilities and knowledge of the Gaelic language : Admits
he had much merit, in collecting‚ and arranging, and trans-
sla.111g; but that he was 110 great poet, nor thoroughly con-
versant in Gaelic literature; So far from composing such

That he could as well compose the Propheeies of Isaiah3 or
create the Island of Skye, as compose a Poem like one οἱ
Ossian's: That there are many other such poems, wh'ich
Mr. Maepherson did not collect, and collected some which
he did not translate; but made his choice with proper
taste: That the Address to the Sun in the Poem of Car-
thon, wanted two lines in the original, which neither ΜΓ,
Macpnerson, nor any body else, could supply, na)r supply
any thing like them.
