PossMsss οε ossum. 143

The same measure will be found in the original of
another war-song, communicated to the Commfflee,
from memory‚ by its correspondent ‘the Reverend
Mr Gallie, in his letter of 4th March 1801, taken
into this Report, p. 39. That war-song or ode,
with a literal transsation, is as follows:

‘ A mhacain cheann
Nan cursan strann
Ard leumnach righ na‘n sseagh
Lamh threin 'sguch eds ⁷
Croidhe ard gun sexi
Ceann airm nan rinn gear goirt
Gearr fios gu bas
Gun bharc ss1e61b2'1n
Ehi snamh ma dhubh Innishtore
Mar that-manech bhaoil
Do bhuill a laoich
Do ssmil mar chaoir ad cheann
Max· charaio chruin
Do chroidhe gun roinn
Mar laisan oidhch do laun
Cum suar do scia
Is crobbhui nial
Mar ehih bho reul a bhaiffi
,Α mhacain cheann
Nan cursan strann
Sgrios naimhde fios gu lar!

‘ Offspring of the chiefs
Of snorffing, high-bounding steedsz
King of spears ἔ
Strong arm in every trial 3
Ambitious heart without dismay3
