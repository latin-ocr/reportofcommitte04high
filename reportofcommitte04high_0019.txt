mittee conceived it to be foreign to its duty to enter
into any elaborate argument or discuffion on the aua
theuticity of those poenm, or to examine, with cri-
tica] or historical labour, the opinions of different
writers who have made this matter a subjth of cona
troversy. It conceived the purpose of its nomination
to be, to employ the influence-of the Society‚ and
the extenfive communication which it poffeffes with
every part of the Highlands‚ in colleffing what ma-
terials or information it was still prafficable to col-
le&‚ regarding the authenticity and nature of the
poems ascribed to Offian, and particularly of that
celebrated collefflon publissled by Mt· James Mac-
pherson.
