POEMS OF osstAN. 91

chiefly in Ireland and the adjoining coast of Argyll.
ssiire. A short history of this collection, and of the
manner in which Lord Bannatyne first became ac-
quainted with it, is contained in a letter from his
Lordlhip to Mr Mackenzie‚ given in the Appendbz,
p. 280. An account of its contems, by Dr D.
Smith, is subjoined (Appendix‚ p. 285), together
with a fac simile of a paffage in the oldest of the
MSS. This collection, however curious in itself‚
and as exhibiting the early state of writing in the
Highlands, contains but little ancient poetry, and
some of what it does contain appears to be very
much corrupted.

Lachlan's MSS. were communicated to the Com,-
mittee‚ also procured for thern another MS. appa-
rently of great antiquity‚ pronounced by the late ΜΓ
William Robertson, keeper of the Register Office
at Edinburgh‚ to be a writing of the lssth century.
{t bears no date, however, in its extant CO11tents;
but on the cover is a date, written in Gaelic, in black
letter, but in a comparatively modern hand, which
agrees with Mr Robertson's opinion. ⁶ Gknmasan,
