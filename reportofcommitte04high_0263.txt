LETTERS 'ro MR. MACKENZIE. 89

not' opened for many years, a sheet of an old Gaelic poem,
and mentioned to a brother of mine, who was with me at
the time, that I had not the least recollection how I came
by it, upon which he put me in mind that Ι had told him
when he had seen it, with some others, (above twenty
years ago‚) they had been got, (together with a collec-
tion of Proverbs sent to ΜΓ Macintosh,) from Captain
Alexander CampbelL then chamberlain of Kintyre‚ who
had them from one William Μαε Murchy, a musician, and
an amateur of ancient poetry. This circumstance I men-
tion, to shew you how little I troubled my memory with
any particulars relative to these poenis. One circumstance,
however, I remember well, that a man who had given me
the use of a parcel of poenis, without any restriction‚ had
long threatened a prosecution for publishing what he called
translations ⁴of his collection of poem5‚ and* alledged he had
a claim to a share of the profits. I- believe however, upon
enquiry, that he understood the profits were only a serious
loss, as I had been persuaded to run shares with a book-

concern (when my income wasx but thirty pounds a year‚)
that I could never since think of Gaelic poetry with plea-

poems; but on the other side, I have to mention that, in
my observing the beanty of one or two passages in one of
those pocius, (I forgct which) the person who gave it mc
as an ancient poem, said, these were of his own conposition.
This asset-tion, Ι placed then to the account of his vani1y3
but Ι think it right to state it to you as l had it, and leave-rw
to‘ think cf it zvhatyou plsase, I feel no interest in the que-x
stion‚ in its issue, or in the fate of the poetry. Indeed, I
know little of what has been said, pro or con, on the sub-
ject for these many years9 having neither the opportunity
