PQEMS OF ossum,- 43

The -queries sent me may be elucidated in Bade-
noch ancl Lochaber. Yon may gather from what
is above, that this corner can do little in that line.

’ When summer· comes, if my health serves me, I
shall make it my business to see certain old men,
though at a confiderable distance from here, who,
Ι am told, sdo still retain some of Offian’s poenis.

The gentleman to whom I referred in my former
cormspocdence, as a familiar acquaintance of Mr
Maepherson’s and mine, and distinguissied for his
acquaintance with the Gaelic language‚ is, alas! no
more. His name was Lachlane Macpherson of
Strathmalhy. He died in the 1767. Ι have· the
honour to be, with great respe&‚ Sir, the Highland
Society’s‚ and your, most obedient humble servant,

‚ANDREW GALLIE„

In his private correspondence with his friend the
Reverend Dr Kemp, Mr Gallie ventured a conjec-
ture with regard to the MSS. procured by Mr Mac-
pherson‚ which he had ssen in that gentleman’s pos-
session, though his modesty had not allowed him to
mention it in a corre'pondence of so public a nature
as that with the Commitree. This conjecture is
expreffed in the following extra& of a letter (the
greatest part of which is on private business) to Dr
Kemp.

DEAE.
