GAELIC *MANUSGRIPTffi 309

It is, however, worthy of remark, that a chapter of this
ancient work, which is entitled ‘⁶ Slogha Chesair an Inis
Bhreatan,’' or Caesar's Expedition to Britain, contains the
following notice concerning Lochlin, a country-so often rnen-

remarks, that by this name ‘⁶ we understand Sweden, Den-
mark, and Norway*.''
. Whence it is evident‚ that the Rhine formed the western
boundary of the ancient Lochlin, and as the term is still
understood (both in the Welsh and Gaelic) of Denrnmk,
Norway‚ and Sweden, and all those northern regions rnen-
1ioned in the works of the bards, it is obvious that LOCHLIN
