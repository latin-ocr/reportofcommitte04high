LETTERS To MR. MACKENZIE. 91

ther copy of the book has ever done so much service.
I admire your zeal in a matter to which only your
zeal could give much importance. But nothing would
be done to purpose, if we did not attach importance to
it, while we are engaged, as, no doubt, I did, at the
time, to the translating vof Gaelic poems. Ι am, with
respect and regard,
Dear Sir,
Your most humble servant,
ΑῙοΗΝ ὃΜΠ-Η.
