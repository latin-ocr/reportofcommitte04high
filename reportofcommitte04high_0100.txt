which has been often mentioned in the Highlands as
containing a valuable collection of ancient poetry 3
but besides that, the unimportance of this little vo-
lume agrees very ill with the estimation always at-
tached, in that part of the country, to the Leabhar
dem-g, it would appear, from the testimony of Ewan
Maepherson above mentioned, (vide Appendix, p,
97.) that the book so denominated was of a form
and fize very different from the small volume in
questi0n3 and in this agrees the declaration of La
M‘Vuirich‚ (AppendiX‚ p. 275.) though they differ
as to the immediate channel through which ΜΓ Mac-
pherson received this particular book.

One of ΜΤ M-acpherson's executors‚ in the coun-
try, the Reverend ΜΓ Anderson, minister of Kin-
gufie, was extremely attentive to the inquiries of
the Committce. He sent to it· various testimonies‚
from old Highlanders in his neighbourhood, relat-
ing to the subject of those inquiries ; and, after in-
forming the Committee that all Mr Macpherson’s
papers, manuscripts and collectione, relating to the
poetry of Offian, were in London‚ he transmitted,
as the Only thing he had· in his poffeffion which had
any relation to that subject, an exa& copy of certain
notes or memorandums, written, in ΜΓ Macpher-
son’s hand, upon the margin of a copy of the first
edition of his transsation of Offian, which had been
left at ΜΓ Maepherson’s Highland refidence‚ and

which ΜΓ Anderson found· there. These are as fola-
lows ;Ἰ
