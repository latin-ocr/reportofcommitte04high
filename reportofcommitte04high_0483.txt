hind us? The rock of Anteus they call that rock, said
the young man; and the hill of Wrestling is the name of
this hill that you are on. From what cause are they so
named? said Curio. If it be not tedious to you, 1 shall

champion in this land, who had neither father nor mother
of human kind, having been produced from the womb of
earth herself. Anteus son of Terra was his name. Great
indeed was the strength of ‘that person; for neither one man
nor many could contend with him, because when his
strength failed, he would let himself down to the ground,
and as soon as his side touched the earth, he was filled with

wondrous vigour from his proper mother the earth. Yet Ι

could resist his strength. The inhabitants of the land fell
by him, and no ship that entered the port below could re-
tire in safety from him: so that he wasted the whole of
this country, and none dared to approach it either by sea or
land.

After the country around him became a wilderness‚ his
subsistence was the flesh of moose, and deer, beasts ofprey,
bears, and lions, which he daily killed in the wilderness.

He had neither rushes, nor branches, nor skin, nor mg,
nor tartan plaid, ἔξ for his bed—but his side to the ground.

which supplied them with a dress by day, and a covering at night,
