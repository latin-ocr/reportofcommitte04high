LETTERS To MR. MACKENZOE. ἦθ’

,ly introduced into some poems and tales, in which it ought
to have no place. I remember, for instance, to have
heard 30 years ago, a long tale (recited by one M=Phai½
„a taylor in Lorn), of which the hero was Conal Gulbann
mac righ Lochlann, and if I had then translated it, I would
have called him, as I heard him called, son of the king of
Lochlin. But this Conal Gulbann appears from Irish his-
tory to have belonged not to Scandinavia, but to Loigh-
eann (Ingenia) in Ireland.. Thus, some of Mt M.’s in-
advertencies‚ in which he plainly appears to have followed
the oral recitation, without a due investigation' into history,
may tend ‘to illustrate the autheneity of his poems. So
may also the description of some scen335 and names of
places, of the existence of which he had no opportunity
of having any knowledge3 as I had. formerly occasion ‘co
show in one or two instances. proverbial expressions,

sian’s heroes, allusions to their customs aad manners, with
the remains of these poenis being still found in Ifeland (as
wellas in the Highlands of Scotland, as testified by ΜΓ·
Walker in his History of the Irish bards), and the notices
occasionally to* be met with in old Scottish and Irish wri-
ters on this subject, would also tend to throw much light
upon your enquiry. The institution of bards, retained in
‘the' families of several chieftains till the present cen-mry,
will account for the preservation of these poem& by ora}
tradition3 as will also the manners cf the people, whose
winter-evening entertainment was, till very lately5 the re-
petition of poems, tales, and songs, The lang-uage of
these p‘oems being still intelligible, excepting some words,
may be accounted for, from having been constantly repeat-
ed and made familiar, and fmm the Highland'ers having

always remained a separate pe'opie, secluded from the rest

⁷ of the world by their peculias language, customz, and

manners. So the wild Arabs retain, I believe, to ffiiz dags,
