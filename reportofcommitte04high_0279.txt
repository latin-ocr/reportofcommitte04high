Am biodh a Bheist anns gach nair,

ALBIN AND THE DAUGHTER OF MEY.

———-

WHENCE come these dismal sounds that fill om· ears!
W hy do the groves such lamentations send!

W hy sit the virgins on the hin of tears,
While heavy sighs their tender bosoms tend!

They weep for Albin with the flowing hair,
Who perish’d by the emelty of M'ey3

A blameless hero, blooming, young, and fair3
Because he scorn’d her passions to obey.

See on yon western hill the heap of stones,

Which mouming friends have raised o’er his bones Ξ

Ο woman 1 bloody, bloody was thy deed3
The blackness of thy crime exceeds belief 3
