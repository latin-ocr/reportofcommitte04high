That the strength of thy hands vof war, or -thyprowess,

Many a hero will be sonachof om· racc,

He spoke with the force of a breaking wave,
‘⁶ Where shall one hero of those be found?
I prevail over the mighty3
Their battle ydelds in my presence,
As the decayed grove of the 'mountain
Before the rapid sweep of -the Whirlwind·

If I do not receive, with consent,
Thatsubmission which the dread of my furious -strife re-
Ι shall possess myself of Erin for life [quires‚
In defiance of Cormac and of Fingal.'’

When the two chiefs arose
In the strength of their swords and their shields,
The solid earth was removed by their heels
ln the terror-raising contest. ¹ [leys
As the sound of a wood which opposes the wind of the val-
Was the struggle of the champione, maintained in equal

They continued the varying struggle, and the doubtful ex-

Once we wrestled on Ma1m0r; our heels overturned the
wood. Rocks fell from their place3 rivulets changing
their course, fied murmuring from our side! Three days
we renewcd the strife; heroes *stood at a distance and trema-
bled. On the fourth, Fingal says, that the King of the
Ocean fell! but Swaran says, he stood. ψ
