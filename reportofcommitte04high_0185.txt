LETTERS To DR. BLAIR. 11

That the poems contained in the manuscripts belonging
’ἑο the Macmhurichs, were identically the same with those
published. by Mr Macpherson, or nearly so, seems to be
abundantly probable. One reason that induces me to enter-
tain this opinion is this 3 I have conversed with many diffe-
rent persons who had frequently rehearsed, from memory,
several parts of the poems translated by that gentleman,
long before he was an author 3 and I can affirm, that these
several parts, together with> many more of the same kind,
and in the same manner, were rehearsed by the Macmhu-
rich’s times without number. So much in answer to your
first question.

I have, ‘in obedience to your request, made enquiry sor·
all the persons around me who were able to rehearse from
memory any parts of the poems published by Mr Mac-
pherson, andsshave made them to rehearse, in my hearing,
the several fragments or detached pieces of these poems
which they were able to repeat. This done, I compared
with great care the pleces rehearsed by them with Mr Mac-
pherson's translation. These picces‚ 01· fragments, are as
follows :

lst, page 11. The rehearsers are, John Macdonald of
