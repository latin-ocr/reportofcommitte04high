130 REPORT oN THE

tioned its having received from ΜΓ John Mackenzie‚
Mr Maepherson's executor, containing the engage-
ment of Fingal with the Spirit of Loda‚ in the poem
entitled Carrickthura. The entire specimen will be
found in the Appenffix, ΝΟ. 12. p. 162.

The Committee subjoins the paffages in the ori-
ginal Gaelic‚ which it has analized, with a rigidly
literal transsation into English, and annexes the trans-
lation given by Maepherson. From such analysis
and comparison the Committee cannot help giving
its opinion, which it thus puts in the Society’s power
to reject or to confirm, that, in the original, the
scene and its circumstances are given distinffly 3 they
are embodied in clear and accurate description 3 that
in the transsation by Mr Macpherson they are fre-
quently lost in words, of which the found pleases
the ear, but which are of a general, indeterminate
sort, that might belong to any other place or object
of a fimilar kind.
