1. Extract from a Poem ΟΝ DEATH.

„w-ow ,Ἢ

O DISCORD! gnashing fury! rav’nous flend!
Hell's sharpest torment! nauseous qualm of life Ι
You bathe the poniard oft in friendship's breast :
Peace‚ virtue, friendship, harmony and love,
Delightful train of graces, shrink from thee ς
Vice, envy, vfllany, deceitful thoughts,
Blood-thirsty cruehy, insatiate pride,

WVar, woe of mothers and new-married maids‚

- Attend thy shrine, and thence long-plighted leagues

And um'ty are broke‚ thence streams of blood
Flow from the pat-riot’s honest-thinking heart3
And rapine, bloodshed‚ carnage-train of death,
Resistless‚ restless, tear th'unhappy world
