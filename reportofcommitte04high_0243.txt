LETTERS‘ To MR. MACKEN21E‚ &a 69

stioned on that subject, he said that he had in his possession
several pieces of antient poetry. Vl'hen Mr Home desired
to see them, ΜΓ Maepherson asked if he undersfflbd the
Gaelic ? “ Not one word.’' ‘⁶ Then, how can I show you
them ?'' “ Very easily,’' said Mr Home 3 “ translate one of
the poems which you think a good one, and I imagine that
I shall be able to form some opinion of the genius and cha-
racter of the Gaelic poetry.” Mr Maepherson declined the
rask, saying, that his translation would give a very imper-
fect idea of the original. ΜΓ Home, with some difficulty,
persuaded him to try, and in a day or two he brought him
the poem on the death of Oscar3 with which ΜΓ Home
, was so much pleased, that in a few days two or three more
were brought him, which ΜΓ Home carried to Edinburgh‚
and shewed them to Dr Blair, Dr Felgusson, Dr Robertson,
and Lord Elibank‚ who were no less pleased with them than
he had been. In the course of the year, Mr Home carried
the translations which Mr Nlacpherson had given him to
London‚ where they were equally admired.

If ΜΓ Home had been possessed of the second sight,
and could have foreseen that the authenticity of the poems
of Ossian would have ever been called in question, he
might certainly have preserved a more distinct and accurate
account of the manner in which they were brought to light.
It is perhaps unnece'ssary to mention a circumstance which
is probably known to many gentlemen of the Highland
Society. ΜΓ Home, in travelling through the HighlandS,
has met with several common people who repeated to him
many hundred lines of the rhymes, as they called them.
Mt Home having usually with him one or more who un-
derstood the Gaelic language² made the rhymes be repeat-
ed again, which the person who understood both languages
translated, so as to leave no room to doubt that the tales
and songs, sung by the boatmen and herds in the High-
lands, are the poems of Ossian.
