oN MR. H1LL’s SPEmMEN. 141

⁸³ In this letter, (says Mr. Hill), Mac Nab seems to
“ imply that the Fingalians divi-ded their time between
‘⁶ Ireland and Scotland ς, thou-gh the songs themselves
‘⁶ mention only Erin or Irelund, its peculiarities and tradi‘.»
⁴⁶ tions. The following Song, called Ossz'an‘s Praycrs,
‘⁶ which indeed is in many respects the most eurious of any,
‘⁶ is also the only one he gave me that mentions Scotland
‘⁶ or Allabinn. He, however, related tome the· history of
‘⁶ another song3 a copy of which has been published by*
“ Srnith in his Gaelic Antiqm'ties, under the title of The
“ Fall qs Tura ,·· likewise mentioning Scodand, and con-
“ taining some other remarkable particulars‡.”

Now it is certain, that not only the general tradition, but
likewise the ancient poetry of the Highlands‚ as published
by Mr. Hill himself, represents the Fingalians as residing
in scotland, and going thence to· hunt in Ireland ; and thav
they also make repeated mention of the peculi'arities and
traditions of the former kingdom.- It is farther certain,
that Crem-‹ghleannv nan cla-ch is mentioned in the Gaelic
poems as a residence of Fingal3 and that the reciters of
thern allege it to be Glenlyon in Perthshire‚ where a round
building formed of huge stones without mortar or cem-ent,
is still known by the narne of Tigh Chrom-ghlinn narr
clach. But let us attend to what Mr. Hill himself says up-
on this head.

‘⁶ Glenlyon‚ which Mac Nab in his letter speaks of as
‘⁶ one of the principa] abodes o‘f the Fingalians‚ lies in the
‘⁵ western part of Perthshire., on the borders of Argyle-
⁴⁶ shire, near Loch Tay.

“¹ Throughout this country are many ruins of rude stone
‘⁴ walls, constructed in a circle3 the stenes of which are
‘⁶ very large: these are said by tradition to be the work of

‘3 Fingal and h-is heroesa One of these ruins is close by
