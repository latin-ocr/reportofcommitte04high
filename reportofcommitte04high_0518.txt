ΙΝ the house of Temora of melodicus cruits
As we were engaged 1n drinking,
Mutual provocation roused to wrath
Carril, the graceful hero, and Momad the great⁰
The championsrose to wressse, V
Heavier than lead was the pressure of their feet 3
Afar was heard the panting of their breasts;
While sad m suspence stood the heroes of Fingal
Stones and heavy earth · - ·-
Were dug up by their heels m strffe,
Whilst they struggled during the day
without determining which was the best in deeds oi
strength.
On the morning of the second day,
The champions engaged again,
Carril of the pointed arms of victory,
And Gaul of the keen tempered swords.
F olded in each other’s grasp, · ”
They anxious twined‚ and pulled and turned,
Till opposing arms to arms in perilous contest,
The sound of their strokes was regretted by all&
Osten did fire corne from their arms

· And wrought foam from their white breasts 3

Their tough spears were hacked
And their shields hewn down to the ground.
