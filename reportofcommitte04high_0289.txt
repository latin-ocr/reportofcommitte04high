Hc sei‘zed the mountain ash by the top,
And tore a branch from the trunl<5
Bm as he was taking his· stepS toward land,
The rouzed monster observed him.

Overtook him a& hp was swimmffig,
And grasped his hand in its gaping gorgfflr
Fraoch seized the monstei· by the jawg ’
‘would Fra'och had now his dagger ἶ

The monster mangled his bosom fair, ⁷
And gnawing tore his arm away.
The white-handed maid¹ went in haste,
Bearing a dagger which p'roved of no avail,

The conflic't was but a 'conflisszt of shqrt continuance3
His hand still held by its head:

Woful was the end of the strife
Between Fraoch‚ son of Fiach, and the‘monste'ra

They fell soie to soie,

At those brown stbnes on the shore:
Which as the gentle maid behem, . ι
She fell on the beach a cloud of mist. ³⁶3¹

§When she awoke from her ‘torpor'⁵
She took his softened hand in hers, „

“ Though you be to pight a mangled prey for fowls,
Great is the deed you have performed. ’²

‘⁸ An expression frequent in the Gaelic for-swoohfng or fainting.
