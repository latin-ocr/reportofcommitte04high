vox-:MS cF OSSIAN. 59

The first line, for example, of Offian’s expedition
to the Lake of Lego, in suit of Evirallin (p. 11.)‚
‘ Is cuth duine far nach Fionduin‚' is quite inexpli-
cable‚ the word Fionduin being unknown in the
Gaelic language, and the word cuth an obsolete ex-
preffion for head, admitting in this situation of no
meaning. So is likewise ‘Saoith Locha Leige’ (stanza
3.), ‘ Do chloth, dhuinn’ (stanza 8.), and ⁶ Seachd
catha d’an dea mhalaidh' (stanza 10.)

Stanza 17. ⁶ Bu Chomhrag' διε. has no meaning

fignificant. The rest of the more ancient poems are
also more or less corrupted, except Fingal's advice
to Oscar (p. ΒΑ), which is perfeffly correct, and
the same as it appears in the copy furnissied the So-
ciety by ΜΓ Maedonald of Staffa‚ which is given in
a comparison of Mr Maepherson's transsations with
parallel paffages, in the poems collected by the Com-
mittee, Appendix‚ ΝΟ. 15.

Of those who, since the time of Maepherson,
have collected or publiihed Gaeiic poetry, the most
intelligent and successful is the Reverend Dr Smith,
minister of Campbelton in Argylessiire, who pub--
fflhed, in the year 1780, Differtati01is on Gaelic An-
tiquities, to which were subjoined„ a Collection of
Ancient Poems, transsated from the Gaelic of Os-
fian, Ullin, Orran, and others 3 and the Doctor af-
terwards, in 1787, publiihed the originals of the
poenis he had so transsated, Some account of the

manner in which he procured these originale, him-
