Moumful am 1 without the found of joy,

But the heavy note of grief constantly founding .·
The mufical cruit *θ’ of the sweetest strain

Will nofi avmke my beart to joy.

'My mind is sunk into the depth of waves‚

Hossow murmuring, without repose or qniet 3
While I bear constantly in mind thy manners,
Oh! my arrow-wound of grief without cure!

No more shall I hear {hy conversation,
Sweeter than the music of bards,

Or the thrm‘h in the lonely vales ς
Which has left my beart for ever sad.

No more shall thy countenance be seen

To brighten in the tower of Connal.

Alas ! I am fallen under a flood of sorrow z
When, my love ἱ shall light beam on thee ἓ

Dark is thy dwelling under the sod,
Narrow and frozen is thy bare bed ;

Never will the morning {hine

That shall wake my lov'e from his ssumber l’
