There is, in one of the poems of Dr Smith's col-
lection, a paffage which the Committee cannot refist
adding to those already given, from its exemplify-
ing, in a remarkable manner, the natural appear-
anceS‚ on which the melancholy superstition of the
inhabitants of a mountainous country, in such a
state of society and manners as the poems in question
exhibit‚ might found their mythology, {f it may be
so called, of the ghosts of their ancestors and de-
parted friends. It is contained in the opening of
a poem called ‘ Finan and Lorma‚' where the young
people around him, looking on the heavens, address
the aged Offian in the following natural and beauti-
ful verses, of which the original will be found in

the Appendix‚ p. 187.

The literal transsation is as follows :

⁶ The mountain, O hard Ξ is bright‚
And the shadow of the moon is in Coathan θ* ,-
The ghosts of the mountain spcak,
And the voice of a spirit is in the fold of the wind.
But it is a different appearance that draws our attention-
Two clouds that hoves in the host of night 3
They move over Alva of roes,
While their locks are spread on the gale of the mountain.

*ἢ A river so called, running through Glcan Caothmz, or the
Vale qs Come, as it has been poetically rendered.
