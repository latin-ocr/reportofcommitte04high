266 NOTES.

Europe to the eastward‚ was stamped with the epithet‘ of
Celtic, 'as was also its westerly point, Cape F inisterre (ld.
L. IV. c. 20.).

After the great body of Celts had moved from Germany,
in their western progress, across the Rhine‚ a considerable
number continued to dwell in that country. vFor we learn
from Tacitus (de morib. Germ. c. 43, 45.) that the Gal-
lie and British languages, which still distinguish the ge-¹
nuine posterity of the ancient Celts, were spoken so late as
the beginning of the second century by the Gothini and
AEstyii3 and that the Cimbri (Ib. e. 37), one of the two
denominations into which the Celtic family branched out
at the earliest period of its history, still continued, though
greatly reduced in number, to occupy that portion of Ger-
many' from which their renowned ancestors had issued
forth in conjunction with the Teutones, 210 years before,
to crush four consular armies, and force the Roman re-
public to the brink of ruin.

So near a neighbourhood, and so long and familiar an in-
tercourse as subsisted between the Celts of Germany and the
Teutones, could not fail to affect the language of both.
How far that of the former was affected in this way it is
impossible to determine, stIoremarusa, preserved by Pliny
(Lib. IV. c. hh), being the only recorded sample‘of it.
But the extent to which the speech of the latter was eurich-
ed in this respect, may be judged of in some measure by
the Scots or Irish, and Weleh words, which are found in
the various dialects of the Teutonic. Some of these are
also common to the Oriental languages and the Greek and
Latin ς so that they may be fairly presumed to have form-
ed a part of the primitive language of Asia, the cradle of
our raee, and to have been brought from thence by the first

geograpt. Dalm. Annot. in C. Plin.N;1t. Hist. L. VI. c. 13. p 324. Lnga.
