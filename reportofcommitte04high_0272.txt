93 MACP'HERSON’s DECLARA’Hom

has decayed greatly with the discouragement of the bard53
but that he never heard the authenticity of the poenis of
Ossian called in question by dny Highlander, and ‘has no
doubt of their being the productions of the genius of Os«
sian, as firmly as he believes in the authenticity of any
other poenis, or in the originality of any other work an-
cient or modern: That he never could have conceived 'that
'any individuals could have the hardiness to put their own
sceptical conceits in opposition to the uniform tradition cf
ages, and the unanimous and unwearied opinion of a whole
nation for many successive generations, of the authenticity
of these poems, and of the heroes celebrated in them, hav-
ing existed: and he does not believe it would be possible
for men who understood Gaelic well, to have any doubt on
this subject: That the declarant has no doubt that the Fin-
galians were Scotch HighlanderS, but looks upon all dis-
putes regarding the Era, and the particular soenes of action,
to be totally independent of the authenticity of the pocius,
which he believes to have come down from remote antiqui-
ty, as firmly as he believes iii his own existence: That
some time Subsequent to the above exmrsion, he met Mx-
James lWacpherson at Edinburgh, and was presented by
him with a copy of Fingal : That he recollects to have read
a part of it, and to have been then of opinion, as far as he
could recollect the substance of the original, that this trans·-
lation was well executed ; though the ablest that ever exist-
ed could not, in the declarant’s opinion, equa] the original
Gaelic by any translation.
