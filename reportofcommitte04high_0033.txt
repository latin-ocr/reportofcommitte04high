such disadvantages‚ with an anxiety perfeftly to un..

In conduffing this inquiry, the Committee wissietl
to be guided not only by the strictest impartiality‚
sbut by a feeling of scrupulous delicacy towards every
person whose name or chara&er was in any de-
gree implicated in the subject. 'The Committee
wished to conclu& its inquiries, an'd to frame its re-
port‚ in a manner as impersonal as poffible. It has
been, however, under the absolute necessity of men« “
tioning the names of some individuals, and of pro-
ducing some documents relative to the character and
disposition, as well as the fituation of Mr James Mac- .
pherson‚ and of a few other persons inti-mately con-

nected with the matter of its investigation. The Com- f

mittee hopes, that in such unavoidable notice of indivi-
duale, it has observed every poffible delicacy. The
Committee feels it a duty to speak of every one, with
moderatiori and with diffidence‚ but especially of
those who are no more; although ‘⁶ de mortuis nil
nis1 bonum” is a false maxim in criticism‚ as well as
in history ; yet it is fase, as well as candid, to speak
with caution of the actions and motives of those who
‘cannot now be questioned as to their aetions or mo-
tives 3 who cannot now explain what is doubtful, or
account for what seems contradictory.

puted‚ that a traditionary history of a great hero or
chief, called an, Fion na Cael, or, as it is modern-
