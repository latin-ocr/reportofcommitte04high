Would it had been in the strife of heroes„
That Fraoch the bestower of gold had fallen2,
Sad is his having fallen by a monster,
Woeful it is to survive him ἔ

Blacker than the raven· was the gvowth of his hair,-
Redder was his cheek than the blood of the· fawn ς
Smoother than the foam of streams,

Whiter than snow was the skin of Fraoch.

Stronger than a gato was his shield,
Many a hero gathered around· it;
Long as his sword* was his arm,
Broad· as the plank of a ship wasv his blade-²

Taller than a mast was his spear‚
Sweeter than the string of music was his voice,
A swimrner who excelled Fraoch
'N‘ever laid his side to· a stream.

Good was the stvength of his a-r-ms',
And exceeding good was the swiftness of his feeh
In soul he was superior to a king?
Of champion' he never declined the combas.

Lovely was the chief whom the people esteemed,.
Lovely the cheek which vied with the rose in redness,
‘Lovely the mouth which opposed not friendship’s cal]-2
And which the fair decline& not to kisse-

We bore to the grove of Fraoch,
The body of the hero to its circular pah‘. φ
After the worthy has died,
To be alive isuour regret‘,
