LETTERS TO DR. BLAIR. 222:

Some old men who value themselves for having goisleni
some of these wagers. The Highlanders, at their festival&
and other public meetings, acted the pocm3 of Ossan„
Rude and simple as their manner of acting was, yet any
brave or generous action, any injury or distress, exhibite}
in the representation, had a surprising effect towards rais-
ing in them corresponding passion's ancl sentiments.

It was 'in my house that Mt Macpherson got the dem

scription of Cuehullin’s horses and car, in book 151⁹, p. Π,
from Allan Mac Caskie, schoolmaster, and Rory Mac-
leod, both of this glen : he has not taken in the whole of
the descripti0n3 and his translation of it, (spirited and
pretty as it appearS, as far as it goes,) falls so far short of
the original in the picture it exhibits of Cuchullin's horses
and car, their harness and trappings, &tc- that in none of
his translations is the inequality of Macpherson’s genius to
that of Ossian so very conspicuous.
’Δ The battle of Lena, in book 2d, is still preserved by
tradition in this country, but with this variation, that the
proposal of giving up his wife and dog, in p. 26, as the
only condition on which peace would be granted, was made
by lN'Iagnus, king of Lochlin, to Fingal, and not by Swa-
ranv to Cuchullin. It was a principle with Fingal, from
which he never deviatecl, notbto engage in battle without
first offering the best terms of peace his honour would per-
mit. Agreeably to this principle, he sent proposals to
Magnu53 in return to which, hlagnus demanded his wife
and dog, which Fingal rejecting wi'th indignation, the battle
began. ¹ η

Ι have heard the poem, in book 3d, relating'Fingal’s
voyage to Lochlin, the snares laid for· him by Starno, 'death
'of Agandecca, how for his ctuelty‘and perfidiousness he
took immediate revenge on Statue, when, p. 38,-he eyed ν
his valiant chiefs, his valiant chiefs took arms..
