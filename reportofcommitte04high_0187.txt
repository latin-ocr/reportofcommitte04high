LETTERS TO DR. BLAIR’. 133

equal, as far as they go, to any thing that Mr Maepherson
has yet published. If so, the literary world should do
that gentleman the justice to believe, that he is not himselfi'
the real author of the compositions he has ascribed to Os*-
sian, or should allow that the Highlands have heretofore
produced bards of a character not less exalted than that of
which Ossian was possessed, according to ΜΓ Maepher-

they are able to compare it, w'rth the original contained inx
