Such as I have not seen nor heard of,
As a cloud gives out its fire,
Each hero dealt destruction.

As they fell under our feet in battle.
Man0s‚ leader of the host, has fallen,
Like a fiery meteor in the firth of currents.

When their spreading voice was heard amund,
Except a man who sought his peace
Or who took protection under our shield‚ V
None of the followers of Lochlin’s king
Returned to his own land.
I declare by my king,
Who was never defeated in battle,

That there fell in our seven bands
A third of the chiefs of Inisfail.

Alone the fight I try'd z
