POEMS OF oss1AN. ΘΧ

plierson‚ translator of Offian's poemS‚ was, for some
years before he entered on that work, my intimate
acquaintance and friend. When he returned from
his tour through the Western Highlands and Issands,
he cume to my house in Erae-Badenoch z I inquired
the success of his joumey, and he produced several
volumes, small ottavo, or rather large duodecimo,
in the Gaelic language and characters, being the
poems of Offian, and other ancient bards.

I remember perfectly‚ that many of those volumes
were, at the close, said to have been collected by
Paul Macmhuirich Bard Clanraonuil‚ and about the
beginning of the 14th century. Mr Macpherson and Ι
were of opinion, that though the bard collected them,
yet that they must have been writ by an ecclefiastic‚
for the characters and spelling were most beautiful
and correct. Ev‘ery poem had its first letter of its
first word most elegantly flourissoed and gilded ; some
ted, some yellow‚ asome blue, and some green: the
material writ on seemed to be a limber, yet coarse
and dark vellum z the volumes were bound in strong
parchment: Mr Maepherson had them from Clanu
ronald.

At that time Ι could read the Gaelic characters,
though with difficulty, and did often amuse myself
with reading here and there in those poems, while
Mr Macpherson was employed on his transsation.
At times we differed as to the meaning οἱ certain
words in the original.

With much labour I have recovered some scatter—
ed parts of the transsation made at my fite-fide, Ι

should.
