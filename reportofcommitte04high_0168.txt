150 REPORT oN THE

of the poemS‚ indeed, particularly those of an in-
ferior and more corrupted class, speak of the spOi}
to be acquired by the conquerors3 but it seems to
have been more a mark of superiority‚ or an ac-
‘knowledgment of subjection, than the fruit of pil-
lage3 and inhumanity to the conquered and the
captive is never supposed to be a legitimate use of
victory.

In considering this matter, the Committee begs
leave also to suggest, that some allowance ought al-
ways to be made for the c'olouring of poetry‚ on the
manners and sentiments of the heroic persons of
whom it speaks. If Offian, or whoever he was who
composed the poems in question, had that humanity
and tenderness which are so generally the attendants
on genius, he might, though he could not create
manners of which there was no archetype in life„
transfuse into his poetical narrative a portion of ima·
ginary delicacy and gendeness, which, while it fiat-
ters the feelings of the poet himself, gives at the
same time a dignity, a grace, and an interest to his

picture.
