a‘uthor who'wrote near the beginning of last century,- thei:
St 'Patriok had actually a convetu a disciple of this name,-
who was afterwards dignified with the title of St Ossin‚ or
Ossian, who is no doubt the speaker in this poem3 which
Golgan, who mentions it, observes, could not b‘e ascribed
‘so the son of FingaL who lived long before the time of Se

‚‚ Patria-lx, or, as he says, in the, reign of king Gormac.

⁴* The same author, in a note to a passage in which mention
is made of F ingal (or Firmius filius Gabbam). in one of
the lives of St Columba, says he was much celebrated in
poems and tales inter suos ,- by which, Ι suppost :abe mean-5
that he belonged to this country5 and not to Ireland, as in
that case he would have said inter nos παῖσα. But as it is not
your object at present to ascertain ‘the time and place, but
only the poeny of Ossian, I wi'ss not enter into any histo-³
ficol, chronological, or topographieal disquisition, which
would exceed the ordinary bounds of a letter, aheedy suf-¹
’ ficiently long. Such a disquisition, however, would be
very satisfying, and sffiould make a part o'f your plan, as
it would not only add to the weight of other evidence, but
go a great length to account for the peculial* manners of
the poen-y, and go far to remove some of the strongest
objections that have been made to the authenticity of Os-m
sian. Some of these objections have been occasioned by
Mr M.’s notes, and are not charge-able on the poet3 such
πίε that in which he supposes Ossi'an’s epithct of Car-acuil
m- Gmghuil, (fierce-eyed) to be a proper name, and to
:nean Caracalla. I suspect also, that ahhough Lochlan
{as appears ffom several passages of a very ancient Irish
of Caelio autho'a. now before me) was of old a general
name with us for all Germany as weH as scandinavia, Μι-
M. may have sometimes implicitly used it (as I did my-·
self‚) in conformity 10 ora] recisation, without attending
always to the circumstances of the case. Our later inter-
course with the Daue-s occasioned Lochlan to be frequent—
