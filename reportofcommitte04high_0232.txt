58 LETTERS To MR. MACKENZIE‚ &a

Presace which is prefixed to thern, in consequence of 11ιᾶ
conversations I had held with Mr Macpherson.

The Fragments, when published, drew much attention3
and excited‚ among all persons of taste and letters, au ear-s-
ne'st desire to recover‚v if possible3 all those considerable
remains of Gaelic poetry which were said 'still to exist in
the Highlands. When Mr Macpherson was spoken to on
the subject,- and urged by several persons to undertake thc
search, he showed'extreme unwillingness to engage in it3
:representing both his diffidence of success and os public
approbation, and the difficulty and expensiveness of such 3
Δεεειῐιέῑι as was requisite through the remote Highlands. At
length, to encourage him to undertake it, a maeting was
brought together at a dinner, to which Mr Macpherson
was invited, and which I had a chief hand in convocating,
of many of the first persons of rank and taste in Edinburgh·
The late Patrick Lord Elibank took a great lead at that
meeting, together with Dr Robertson, Μι- John Home, Sir
Adam Fergusson, and many others whom I have now
forgotten, who were all very zealous for forwarding the
discovery proposed3 and after much conversationvwith Mr
hlacpherson, it was agreed, that he should disengage him-
self from all other employment, and set out without delay
on this poetica] mission throughout the Highlands 3 and as
his circumstances did not admit of his engaging in this at
his own expenee, that the whole expence he ‘might under-
go was to be defrayed by a collection raised from this meet-
ing, with the aid of such other friends as we might chuse
to apply to for that purpose 3 and we, in effect, engaged for
his future success. Mr Robert Chalmers, if I remember
right, was the person who undertook to collect the money,
and to act as our treasurer. I remembcr well, tha-t when
the company were abom to break up, and I was going a-
way, 1¹va ‘Macpherson followed me to the door, and told
me that from the spirit of that meeung‚ he now for the.
