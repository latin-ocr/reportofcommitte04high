coPY OF ANOT'HER LETTER FROM THE SAME To
THE SAME.

m DEAR 5113,

Ι am very glad you have undertak-
en the task which I used the freedom to recommend
to you. Nothing less than what you propose will
serve the purpose. You need expe& no assistance
from Macpherson, who flew into a paffion when Ι
told him of the letter I had wrote to you : But you
must not mind so strange and heteroclite a mortal,
than whom I have scarce ever known a man more
perverse and unamiable. He will probably depart
for Florida with Governor Johnstone‚ and Ι would
advise him to travel among the Chickisaws or Che-
rokees‚ in order to tame him and civilize him,

Ι should be much pleased to hear of ,the success of
your labours. Your method of directing to me is
under cover to the Earl of Hertford, Northumber-
land House. Any letters that come to me under
that direction, will be sent over to me at Paris.

I have no present thoughts of publishing the work
you mention 3 but whenI do, I hope you have no
objection of my dedicating it to you.

Ι beg my compliments to Robertson and Jardine.
I am very sorry to hear of the state of Ferguffon’s
health. John Home went to the country yesterday
with Lord Bute. I was introduced the other day to
