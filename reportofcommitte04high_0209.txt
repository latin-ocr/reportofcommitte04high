LETTERS To nn, BLAIR. 35

the neighbouring continent were very numerous. There
are the remains of about thirty places of worship in this
and the two neighbouring parsshes, besides monasteries.
These reformers were certainly animated with the usual
zeal of extinguishing the old religion, with all its appurte-
nances. The sacred hymns suffered in this devastati0n‚
for there is not one couplet of them existing. You will
perhaps be surprised to hear, that the goddess of Victory,
Andate‚ (the Andraste of Di0,) who had a temple at Ca-
malodunum, had a particular veneration paid her in this
part of the world. There are no less than the remains of
four places of worship for her in this island: the rnost
considerable of them> lies within an half mile of the castle
of Dunvegam (Anaid in Buy) of which Macleod will
give you a description. As human sacrifices were offered
at her shrine, the christian missionaries must have been
greatly shocked at the priests who officiated at these
bloody rituals; in so far that, to this day, when we talk
of a cruel savage‚ we call him a Druid. A little reflec-
tion will easily account for the loss of the sacred poems,
as well as for the little notice taken of religion in the he-
roic ones. Perhaps it would have been construed a
sacrilegious encroachment on the holy office, to mention
the concerns *of religion in profane songs3 or, if any
such mention was made, the rehearsers in after times
would have been taught to drop it, as an abomination to
’ christian ears. I should ask your pardon for obtrud-
ing all this trash upon you, bnt believe me to be, very
respectfully‚
Reverend and dear Sir,
Your very affectionate
humble servant,
DoN. MACQJEEN.
