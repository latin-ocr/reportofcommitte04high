'70 REPORT oN THE*

· Meckenziffi which, in justice to Mr M‘Diarmid‚ as

well as to Dr Smith‚ the Committee thinks it pro-
per to lay before the Society.

‘ δικ,

⁶ On* the other page my father has sent ga
copy of Offian’s Addreffes to the Sun. The Bed of
Gaul, Mr M⁸Farlane‚ from whom my father had it,
got from a person in Argyleshire, who had heard it

in his youth. Neither Mr' M‘Farlane nor my fat, ,

ther suspee'ted its being already in print 3 but, a feu}

Dr Smith of Campbeltown, my father observed it
at the conelufion of the poem intitled ⁶ Tiomnczh
Ghuil? This mistake Ι hope you will have the good-
ness to excuse, as it arose merely from ignorance of
what Dr Smith had done. ’ Mr M‘Farlane's finding
'it by a different channel from Dr Smith, yo'u will
no doubt look upon as a proof of its authenticity.³

two poems will also be ‘found in the Appendix,
