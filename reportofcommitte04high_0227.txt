boenas. *We ndmired the purity of the stile5 we were
much charmed with the descriptions contained in them3 and
some of the sentiments were noble and sublime: to this
ond, we informed ourselves as to those old people that
'could repeat parts of them, and got their name, but we
could not, from the best. informatiom learn that there was
any manuscript of them in ‘this part of the kingdom. We
indeed got a long list of poems, said to be Composed by
Ossian, and wrote some of them3 viz. such as we found
to answer¹ our expectation33 however ’that gentleman’s
death put an end to that scheme. vWhen I heard of Mt
Maepherson’s translation, I was very carious to see it3 but
no copy came to this cornerwhere I live till last summer4
and at last I had my curiosity gratified. And the very ᾔτεέ
ΐΙιίης I did, was to examinetis any part of these poems'
were in our collection3 answe-rably I found that what is
called Erragon in Mr Maepherson's Temora, is called
Dibird f li, in the Gaelic in our Highlands. “ Dibird ΗΞ
gun drin sum, in Alvi ri linn no laoich’', so the poem be·-
gins 3 which poem some old women repeat with great spi·-
Jrit. Also, Lazhmon, we have fragments of it ¹; and the>
poem which mentions the death of Oscar, is called ,with
³215, Ca Gaur. I followed the enquiry no farther then, nor
indeed could Ῐ do it now to any-purpose, unless I could
collect all these fragments that old people still remember.·
This could be done at a small expence3 and if Dr Blair'
would but propose it ro some generous people, they would
contribute ten pounds‚ which would execute the scheme3
and these venerable productions ¹would be preserved.

Many of· them indeed are lost, partly owing to our‘
clergy‚ who were declared enerm'es to these poems ; so that
'the rising- generation scarcely know any thing material of
them. However, we have still some that are famous for

repeating them, and these people never heard of ΜΓ Μεῑςὲ
