One manuscript in particular was written as far back as
the year 1410, which I saw in Mr Maepherson’s posses-

takento illustrate the beauties, and establish the reputation,
of the poems of Ossian, which do so much honour to the
ancient genius of our country. I am, with great emerem,
Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
LACHLAN M’PHERsoN.
