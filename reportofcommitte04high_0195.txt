J'Rm-:DEAR BRQTHER, v

I received your favour of
the 5th' of October sometime in November last, and I
Would have acknowledged itv long ago if I did not expect
to find more satisfactory answers to your enquiries than I
could give of myself. My copy of F ingal happened to be

aged gentleman in his neighbourhood, knows of these
poems of Ossian. 'This man assured me, that, in his
younger days, he heard F ingal repeated very frequently in
the original, just as Mr Macpherson has translated it. He
lived then in the island of Ila: I employed some of my
friends there to enquire whether this poem is xstill exant
there, but without success. I was informed also, that a
man who died in this island about fifteen years ago, had a
manuscript of the poems of Ossian. I wrote to a nephew
of his, into whose hands that man’s books and papers have
fallen, but have had no answer hitherto. I soon will; and

persons in this or the other parishes in Mull, who have
any poems in Gaelic of F ingal, or his heroes. There are
still a great many of them handed down by tradition3 but
