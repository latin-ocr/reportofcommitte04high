Burst‚ burst, my heart ! the lovely youth is (lead, Ι

who, like the dawn, was wont to bring me jojssr,
Now birds of prey will hover round 1115 head,

And wilcl beasts seek his carcase to destroy ;
While I who lov'd 111111, and was lov’d again,

With sighs and lamemable strains must tell,
How by no hero's valour he was slain,

But struggling with a beast inglorious fell ’ἶ
Τ1115 makes my ‘tears with double anguish flow,
This adds affiiction to my bitter woe l

Yet fame and dauntless valour he could boast;

With matchless strength 1115 manly limbs were

bound 3 .

What force would have dismay’d arnighty bost,

He sbow'd, before the dragon could him wound.
His curling looks, that wanton’d in the breeze,

Were blacker than the raven’s ebon wing3
His teeth were whiter than the fragrant trees,

WVhen blossoms clothe them in the days of spring ξ
A brighter red his glowing cheeks did stain,
Than blood of tesider heifer newly slain.

A purer azuresparkled in his eye,

Than that of icy shoal in mountain found3
Whene’er he spoke, his voice was melody,

And sweeter far than instrumenta] sound.
O he was lovely ! fair as purest sn0w‚

W'hose wreaths the tops of highest mountain&=

¹ crown ;

His lips were radiant as the heav’nly bow;

1115 skin was softer than the softest down,
More sweet 1115 breath, than fragrant bloom, or rosc,
Or gale that cross a flow’ry garden blows.
