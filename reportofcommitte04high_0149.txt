Literal Transsation.

‘ Innistore rose ssowly‚
And Carrickthura, chz'qfof waves ὕ.

Maepherson's Transsation.

‘ Innistore rose to fight, and Carrickthura's moffy towers?

In the original there is no rising 1‘0 sight, no mossy
towers ; but the pi&ure‚ vivid to the imagination‚ is
fimple in the expreffion : ⁶ Innistore rose slowly?
with that ssowness with which a distant object rises
to the fight—and ‘ Carrickthura‚ chief of waves 3’
expreffing the fituation of the place in a command-
ing point of view, above the sea,

‘ Bha comhara beud gu h-ard
›Teine dau 's a thaobh san smfiid?

‘ The signal of evil (or violence) was on high,
A blind fire, with its fide in smoke.'

‘ But the fign of distress was on their top3 the warning
flame edged with smol<e.’

I 2 Having

ᾗ τ’. e. Rifing majestically above the sea. lull, in the Wcst,
Highlands‚ is used to express a land-mark.
