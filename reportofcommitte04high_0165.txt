r-OEMS OF oss1AN. 147

The first of these is the, circumstance of the lan-
guage, in poenis of such antiquity, being so nearly
what it still is, in the common use and understand-
ing of the country. Perhaps the situation of the
Highlands and Issands, where this poetry has been
preserved, and the little communication they had
with other countries, may in some measure account
for this circumstance. Language is changed from
its use in society, as coins are smoothed by their cur-
rency in circulation. lf the one be locked up a·
mong a rude, remote, and unconnecled people, like
the other when it is buried under the earth, its great
features and general form will be but little altered.
Certain it is, that, with the allowancetof a sorne-
what different orffiogmphy, and a few words now
in disuse, which the best Celtic scholare could
not make out without the help of the context, the
language of the ancient MSS. publiffied by Miss
Brooke and others, in Ireland, and also that of those
in the poffeffion of the Society, is very much the
same with that which proficiente in the Gaelic now
write, and is perfeEtIy intelligible to such persons.

Another circumstance of difficulty is, that any
human memory should be able to retain poems of
such⁸ length, and so numerous, as some of those
Highlanders, from whose oral recitation the collec-
tors of such poems obtained them, repeated. But
the power of memory in persons accustomed from
their infancy to such repetitions, and who are unable
to affist or to injure it by writing, must not be judg-
ed of by any ideas or any experience poffeffed by
