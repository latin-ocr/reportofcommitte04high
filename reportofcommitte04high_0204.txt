30 LETTERS 'ro DR. BLAm.

The poem &book the 4th, is handed down pretty entire
in this country, in which each of Fingal’s chiefs singles
out the chief among the enemy he was to fight, leaving to
Fingal the honour of e'ngaging the king of Lochlin. The
description of the 51111-1>63.111,Ρ11133Ρ5512111111111, does not
corne up to the beauty and spirit of the original. Along
With that of the sun-be'mn, there is in the original a parti-
cular description ,of the standards of the seiten principal

chiefs of Fingal, which are all so inimitably beautiful tha't

²⁵ I cannot imagine how Macplierson has omitted them in hi‘s
translation. Dermod, who led the right hand of the army
to that battle, (as it is expressed in the 011 ginaL) had a
standard which, in magnificence, far exceeded the sun-2
bearn. He 15, by the tradition of this country, said to be the
predecessor of the Campbells.

We have the poem containing the battle of Lochlego‚
and a good part of that relating the war of Inis-thona, in
page 104.

It would take up too 11111611 100111, and I think it is not.
necessary that I go through all the poems in the collection,
of which we have pieces joined to other poems, and some-
times parts of two or three poems thrown together into
one.

Mr Maepherson, 111 1115 journey through the Highlands,
put it upon me to look out for the poem called cath, or the
'battle of Benedin. Ihave since got it, but not till after
the'book was published. The battle is the most 1116111οτ
table of Fingal’s exploits ; and, I humbly think, the poem
is the most finished of Ossian’s works.

Upon the whole, I know not any capable of doing that
justice to the original, which Mr Macpherson has done.
One thing I’m sorry for, his having omitted the descrip-

χ tion which Ossian gives of¹ Fingal'sy ships, their sails,

masts‚ and rigging, their extraordinary feats in sailing,
