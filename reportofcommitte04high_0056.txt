38 ‚REPORT oN THE

lation‚land he and Mr Gallie differing as to the
meaning of some Gaelic words, and that Iwas much
delighted with the transsation, for I was not then
[ΨΕΙΙ ac quain ted with the Gaelic. I have the honour
'to be, with esteem, your most humble servant,

CHR15T1AN GALLiEf
C. M‘Izztosh, Esq.

After receipt of this first letter, the Committee
sent to Mr Gallie a copy of the circular queries a·
bove recsted, p. 2, and added an inquiry who the
friend was whom Mi· Gallie had mentioned as hav-
ing furnished the passage of Gaelic poetry mentioned
in his letter, and as the only other person who knew
as well as himself the state of the poetry colle&ed
by Mr Macpherson. To these inquiries ΜΓ Gallie
replied by the following letter. Mr Laing, we know,
(for the circumstance has he n mentioned to him),
n ill pardon the manner in which his name is men
tioned3 in which, though the zeal of the High-
lander‚ and his prejudice against a supposed un-
friendly disti-181, is not extinguished‚ it is tempered
by that gentleness which the Committee understands

to have been a principa} feature in the good man'e
characier.
