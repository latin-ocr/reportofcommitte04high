’τε LETTERS ’ro MR. MACKENZIE.

The refinement of manners in Ossian’s poems is, as yon
observe, a well known objection against this authenticity.
But let our history be investigafed² and I am satisfied this
objection will be done away. What if we shall produce
passages purely historical, and undeniably more than 1000
years old, that are no less refined and delicate? Take the
first instance that occurs to my memory, and I think it
would not disgrace even the man qf feeling in the leth
century :-—“ See that crane coming towards our shore, in
its ssight over from Ireland. It is quite spentf and obliged
to alight in the water. Run, take up the poor bird, bring
it to the house, feed it, and take care of it for three days,-
till it be sufficiently refreshed, and able to return to its na-
tive land; and for thy kindness and hospitali:y, my son,
God will bless theeJ’ I quote from memory, and do nor
pretend to have the exact rendering of the words, but I am
sure I have the exact rendering of the sentiment. Investi-
gate our history, and it will give credibility to our poeti-y,
in more „respects than in delicacy of sentiment. xNe have
but lately emerged from a long night of barbarism; but
previous to that night, there existed, as there is much rea-
son to believe, a period of considerable light and refine-
ment. I have made some efforts, not as yet very success-
fussy, to penetrate the darkness in which Highland history
is involved. I hope more will be done by those who have
more opportunity ;μ and that the Highland Sociery will at-
tend to the ancient history, as well as to the ancient poetry2
of the Highlands. Ι arn, with respect and esteem‚
