:ts he was unequal to the task of composing the original
'poems, ascribed to that ancient hero.

’ Upon 1110 whole, I think it is evident that even a man,
who has no 300055 10 know the sentiments of Highlanders
'on this subject, and their unanimous testimony in fayour
of Μι- Maepherson‚ can very easily satisfy himself* that
that gentleman could have 110 rational inducement to im-
11050 upon the public 3 and, at any rate, 'could not possibly
succeed in doing it, in the manner ‘of which some are
pleased to suspect him; and it proceeds entirely froin your
good natm-ed indulgence to their unreasonable prejudiceS,
that you are at so much pains to satisfy them 111 idle
doubts, which you never entertained yourself‚ and for
which one would be certainly laughed at in the Hi ghlands,
where, if they complain at all of Mr Maepherson, it 15
because 110 1135 omitted many beautiful pieces of Ossian’ s
works, and not that 110 1135 corrupted thern by any addi-
110115 of 1115 own.

⁸ The public do not know how much they are indebted 10
you in 11115 affair. If they have received any pleasure
from their acquaintance with the works of Ossian, they
owe it all to you. ¹ The remains of the Celtic hard would
have been irretrievably‘ lost, if you had not interposed to
1050110 1110111 from the total oblivion to which they would
very “soon 113110 been consigned. The Highlanders, at least,
are very ⁷sensible of this 3 and they acknowledge also, that
you have enabled them to comprehend more perfectly the
merit and beauties of their fav 0111110 bard. I am,

“ ’ Reverend Sir,
“ Your most obedient
. humble servant,
’ ALEXR. MAc AULAY.
