354 :LETTER FRoM MR. JAMES M‘PHERSON.

fme, how we have now any of the beauties of our ancient
Gaelic poetry remaining.

Your collection, Iam informed, is pure, as you have
‘taken pains to restore the style—I shall not make any apo-
logy for this trouble, as it will be for the honour of our
ancestors, how many of their pieces of genius will be
brought to light—I have met u.›ith a number ofold manu-
scr-{lm in my travels ; the poetical part of them I have endea-
voured to secure¹

If any of that kind falls within your hearing, I beg it of
you, to have them in sight.

I shall probably do myself the pleasure of waiting of
you before I ¹return to Edinburth Your correspondence
„in the mean time, will be very agreeable.-You will
,excuse this trouble from an entire ,stranger3 and believe

eme?

Reverend Sir,
Your most humble Servant,
(Signed) JAMES M‘PHERSON.

lnform me of what you can of the tradition of the
poems: Directto me, by Edinburgh and Ruthven, inclosed

31:¹1⁷. SIR,

I was favoured with your letter inclosing the
Caelio Poems, sor which I hold myself extremely obliged

than Teantach mor na Feine. The last is far from being a
'bad poem, were it complete, and is particularly valuablc
,for the ancient manners it containsff-l shall reckon myselss'
