Rightful heir of Dundalgan *3
Ι am the pledge which you left in the womb'f
When you were learning in Dunscaich ²2*

 

My curse be 011 my mother,
Since she laid· me under engagements‚
Which made me practise feats of arms

Ἰ Against you, O Cuchuillin.

When I behold the arms of the hero,
The shield and the sword of Conlach,
I arn such in lamenting,

 

As a man without son or sponse.

 

Well it is for the victorious Laoghaire
That he did not urin, as‘an instrument of destrucrion}>
This red shielcl' or this sword.

 

Alas ἶ that it was not in Munster of plaiixs9-
Or in Leinster of edged words,
Or in Crudchan of the fier-ce warriors,

That my beloved Conloch fell:

Had you been killed in battle>⁷
In Spain or in Hesperia,
Or in the land of Samus, of free people,

 

 

It is exceeding well for the men of Albion.

’Κ Dundealgan is the ancient name of Dunkeld, a well known town of the
