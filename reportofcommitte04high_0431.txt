Who is he that in the conflict of hosts,
Subdues the fierce and hardy bands of war3
Who causes the standards of hundreds to tremb1e;
And stays the valorous atchievement of the foe?

battle of the kings3 dreadful the look of their eves. Their
dark-brown ›shields are cleft in twain„ Their- steel flies,
