And Fiavi the son of the chace;
Em, son of ,Gara of the whi-te knee,
And Ca01t‚ the saitem, son of Ronan,
Rapid hero of the whitest side :
His side as the foam of the flowing sea,
When the wind pours it on the beach along with thevdrifted
Fraoch‚ also, the liberal son of Feuo, . [snow.
Sugga, the guardian shield of fame3
And the excellent son of the sea-skirted Lucar’s king,
Cormac of the well-fashioned ships.
‘⁶ Son of Cairbar from the red tree !
Bring speedily by the sounding call of thy voice,
The fierce bands, not fierce at home †.’'
Such is the coming of the heroes,
As the roaring wind when it bmshes athwart the Iofty moun-
Like the noise of streams rushing in cataracts, [taim
Their tread is heard afar.
Bright is their face in the armour of their kiudred,
Which distant glearns on the dusky heath.
Their men followed, along'the hill,
To conquest or to death, like a flight of sea fowls.
The sound of battle from shields reared on high,
Ascends alost in air.
The crash of glinering arms
Is echoed from the towering rocks.

 

behind the red meteors of heaven. The sounds of cragh.
ing arms ascend. The grey dogs howl betweem Un-
equal bursts ‘the song of battle. Roeking Cromla echoes
round. On Lena's dusky heath they stand, like mist that
shadcs ihe hius of autumn3 when broken and dark 'n
settles high, and lifts its head to heaven ἶ
