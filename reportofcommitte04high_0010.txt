Bannatyne‚ Sir George M‘Kenzie, Sir John Sin-
clair‚ and Mr M‘Donald of Staffa. To Dr Donald
Smith, late surgeon to the Breadalbane Fencibles,
one of the best Celtic scholars of the present time,
the Committee would endeavour to express its obli-
gation, were not its thanks rendered unneceffary by
those of the Society itself‚ voted to that gentleman,
in a manner most justly due to the ability and un-
wearied attention with which he has affisted the
Committee m the progress of this bufines s; an as
fistance, without which, its Report could never
have been compleated.

The 'Committee, unwilling to lengthen the Ap-
pendix to this Report‚ which it fears will to most of
‘its readers appear already too long, has given only
specimens or extra&s of such documents as it ap,-
peared to the Committee might fairly be judged of
by such specimens or extra&s 3 but the papers them-
selves are open to the inspeffion of any person wilh-
ing to examine them more ffioroughly, who will
take the trouble of applying to the Committee for
that purpose.
