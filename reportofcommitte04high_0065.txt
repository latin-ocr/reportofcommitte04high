pherson’3‚ by a very ingenious lady, Miss Brooke,
who unfortunately, as it appears to the Committee,
gave a transsation >in rhyme, which, for the reason above
stated, p.¹ 20. ,seems to be attendedwith many disadvan-
tages, in rendering ancient poetry into English. She
haS, however, ,prefixed the originals in the character
generally used, till ,of late, in writing Irish and High-
land compofi‘tions,¹ and has thus given to persons
accustomed to read that character, and conversam
with the Irilh language, an opportunity of compar-
ing those originals with her transsation, and also with
poems under similar titles, or on similar subjects,
collected in Scotland. Miss Brooke’s originale have
several passages nearly coincident with those in a
collection madeby Mr Duncan-Kennedy, to be af-
terwards mentioned (now in the Society's poffeffion),
but mixed with others, different both in substance
and expreffion. The coincidence may easily be ac·
counted for, from the place where much of Kenne'ss
dy’s collection was made, namely, the western coast
of Scotland, adjoining to Ireland, and having much
communication with that country. Ireland, as has
already been observed, was, in ancient times, so
much connected with the adjacent coast of Scotland,
that they might almost be considered as one country,
having a community of manners and of language, as
well as the closest political connexion. At a subse-
quent period, the situation of the two countries be-
came confiderably different. After the destruction
of Icolmkill, Ireland sheltered and preserved that
learning which Scotland in a great measure lost;
