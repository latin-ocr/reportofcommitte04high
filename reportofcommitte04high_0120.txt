102 REPORT oN TH'rss

And stood out from among the people‚

Between the man of might and the king.

The warrior of portly form advanced

With wrath and with strength toward them,
And, past us, he rushed on the maid,

As she stood by the ffioulder of Fingah

The son of Morni gave an eager cast

Of his firm spear, to stay him.

Nor weak was the cast ;

It parted his shield in twain.

Gaul of the glowing spirit rushed on,

To hew down the hero, who stood as a rock of iem
Whoever should then behold them,

Furious would seem the strife of death.

The hand of Morni's son laid low

The king of Sora's son—tale of grief!

Sad were our people for the coming of the maid,
On whose accourst the hero fell in dread affray.
After the mighty had fallen

On ocean's strand, O deed of woe l

The daughter of the king of the wavehsurrounded land.
Remained for a year in the land of Fingah

We buried, by the fide of the water-fall,

The man of might and of prowess ;

And we placed on the point of each finger

'A ring of gold, in honour of the king. ³³
