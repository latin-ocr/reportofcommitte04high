10 LETTERS ΤΟ DR. BLAIR. .

I had [reason to believe, that the gentlemen would exest,
all their strength in defending acause in which Dr Blair,
Mr Maepherson, and, let me add, Ι myself, are so deep-'
ly intefiested, especially‘as it is a national one·; but hither-'
to I have not had the- satisfaction of receiving any- the small--¹
est assistance *in 'th‘at way. What I have to say myself,·
in answer to your questions, after having made all the re-f·
searches 'in my power, isin substance as follows : Δ

That I have pemsed a Gaelie manuscript, containing ‘all-¹
the poems translated by Mr Macpherson, o‘r a considerable-³
part of them, Ι am not able to say; but ean honestly afa
firm, that I have seen a Gaelic manuscript in the hands of?
an old bard, who travelled about through ith'e Highlands
and Isles about thirty years ago, out of 'whioh he read, in»
my hearing, and before thousands y'et alive, the explo'i'ts
of Cuchullin, Fingal', Oscar, Ossian, Gaul, 'Dermid, a-nd'
the other heroes celebrated in Mr Maepherson’s book.

This'bard was descended of a race of ancestors who had
served the family of Clanranald for about three hundred
years, in quality of bards and genealogists, and whose
predecessors had beenssemployed in the same office hythe
Lords of the Isles long before the family of Clam-anald
existed. The name of the tribe which produced these he-
reditary poets and shenachies, was Macmhurich. The
last man of the tribe who sustained these two characters
with any dignity I knew personally, and conversed with
him more than once. He was a man of some letters, like
all or most of his predecessors in that office3 and had, to
my certain knowledge, some manuscripts, in verse as well
as prose, in his possession. VVhether these manuscripts
are now extant, I cannot say, as I live at a great distance
from that part of the country where the Macmhurichs'were
settled, and as I have not yet heard from a gentleman there
to whom Ι have written of late upon that subject.
