Luidh iaromh Columb Cille fecht ann gu Ri Cruithnech
.1. gu Bruidhi Mac milcon‚ agus do dunadh dorus in
dunaigh fris, agus do foscuil fo chedoir glaisiarnuidhi an
baili tre urnaidhthi Cholumb chine. Tainic iar sin Mae
in righ .1. Maelcu agus a Drui do frithtagra fri Columb
CiUe ‘tre geinn tlighecht.

The English is as follows:

After this St. Columba went upon a time to the King
of the Picts, namely‚ Bruidhi son of Milchu‚ and the gate
of the castle was shut against him, but the iron locks of
the town opened instantly through the prayers of Columb
Cille. Then came the Son of the King, to wit‚ Maelehu
and his Drm‘d to argue keeuly against Columb Cille in
support of Paganism.

A form of letter somewhat ruder, and seemingly later
by about a century than the foregoing, marks the last
piece in the volume, which is a tale much effaced. It
should seem from the following passage of it exhibited
plate Rs No. 1. that the isles of Innsehorc‚ so frequently
mentioned iu our ancient poems‚ were considered by the
author of it as faeing Scythia3 which makes it probable
that Shetland and Orkney were included in the name,
though the modern reciters of tales and poems usually
consider it as applying only to the latter.
