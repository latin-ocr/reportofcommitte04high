146 OBSERVATIONS

The words which are here translated your own are plural
in the original: So that the whole of the six verses now
quoted, express in the clearest manner, that F ingal and his
venerable son, with the ⁰heroes whom he celebrates, were ⁴
inhabitants and natives of Scotland.

As the two songs which we have just cxamffled, show
Scotland to have been the country of F ingal and his heroes3
so, two other ancient songs with which-Mt. Hill has fa-
voured the public, wilI prove them to have an intimate
connection with the ‘⁵‘ peculiarities a11d.tr2sdjtiens” of that
kingdom. '

⁶⁶ The first of them relates- to the Deathof Dermid2W
Gn a* passage of whichsas* translates} in Smith's Gaelic Ans
iiquities7 p.. 194ae Mr. Hill has this note: ‘⁶ Smith adds,
⁴⁶ that theclan of Campbell, said to be descended from-
‘'‘ Dern1id,2 assume the boar’s head foi· their erest from this
“ event†.’'⁷ And he afterwards remarks in another note‚.
“ As Hengis²t‚ Hom, and the other Saxon chiefs‚- derived
⁶⁸ their pedigree from Odin, so the Campb-ells5 &a derivo
‘⁶ theirs from· Der‘midss and the rest of the Fingalians 123⁹v
And, in truth‚ it is a general belief over all the Highlands
and VVestern Isles of Scodzmd, that the Campbells are de-
scended of this very Dermid: a striking instance of which·
belief is remarked by the Rev. ΜΓ. Pope of Rea‘y‚ in a let-v
ter to Dr. Blair*. But the tradition of it is peculias to
Scotland3 for the account of Irish history is, that the illus-¹·
trious house' of Argyll took its rise from Fathod Cammn,
son of Lughad Mac Con, who succeedcd to the kingdom of
Ireland‘i11·the year 25o†.
