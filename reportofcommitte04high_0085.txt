POEMS oF oss1AN. 67

Feeble was 1161· voice, and few her words;
I raised her up with my hand,
But she laid my palm ott the head of her son,
While her figh rose frequent.—
Dear child, vain is thy fondling,
Thy mother no more §hall arise.
I shall myself be a father to thee,
But Evz‘rallin ἢ* 13 110 more Ρ

The conclufion of the poem is in that dignified
stile of som-ow and of praise‚ which Fingal, whose
lamentation over Gaul it contains, 13 always repre-

sented, in the ancient poenis, as uttering on the loss
of his friends.

‘ What 13 the strength of the warrior,
Though he scatter, as wither’d leaves, the battle?
To-day though he be valiant in the field,
T o-morrow the beetle will prevail over him !’
⁶ Prepare, ye children of mufical strings‚
The bed of Gaul, and his fun-beam † by h‘im,
Where may be seen his resting-place from afar,
Which branches high overshadow‚
Under the wing of the oak of greenest flourish,
Of quickest growth, and most durable form,
Which will ihoot forth its leaves to the breeze of the shower,
While the heath around 13 still wither’d.
Its leaves, from the extremity of the land,
Shall be seen by the birds of summer,

¹* The wife of offian.
† The common term for a stmdagd.
