The most valuable ·of the ancient MSS. proe'ured hy the
Society‚ were got from the late Mr. John Maekenzie of the
Temple, Secretary to the Highland Society of London.
One of these is a large collection of poems composed at va-
rious periods‚ which appears to have belonged to the Rev.
James Mac Gregor‚ Dean of Lismore in Argyllshire. For
on the lower margin of its 27th page (as now numbered by
its remaining ,contents) is written Lliber Dhi Jacobi
Μκ Grigor Decani Lismoren. Part of it was written in
the year 1512. as appears from the concluding lines of its
14⁴1-h page.-“ Dunc‘ha- mac Dowle 'vic Oyine reywich di
sgreyve so a loywrow schenchyth nyn reig· Αο Domin-
millesimo quinmo duodecimo.” Which means in English,
Duncan—son of Dougal, son of Ewan the grizled, wrote
this out of the books of history of the kings in the year of
our Lord 1512. Part of it was written as late as 1527,
which closes an obituary (commencing 1077) of the kings
of Scodand, and other eminent persons of the natica, more
especially, those of the shires of Argyll and Perth.

The 'writer of this MS. rejected the ancient character for
the current handwriting of the time, and adopted a new
§.node of spelling conformable to the' Latin and English
sounds of his own age and country⁷ but retained the aspirate
mark (). Plate HI. ΝΟ. 5. shews asae simile of the title
and first six lines of a poem copied from it into the prece-
ding Report‚ p. 93.

The Welsh had long before made a similar change in
their ancient orthography. ΜΓ. Edward Lhuyd recom-
mended it, with some variation, in aLetter to the Scots
and Irish prefixed to his Dictionary of their language in
the Archaeologia Britannica. The Bishop of Sodor and
Man observed it in the devotional exercises, admonition‚
and catechism, which he published for the use of his dio-
cese. It was continued in the Manx translation of the
Scriptures, ancl it has lately been adopted by Dr. Reilly‚
titular Primate of Irelmd, in his TAGASG KREEs'ri’, or
