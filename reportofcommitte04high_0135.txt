ὅ Beldearg spoke with sweetest voice— . ’
“ Hero of the gentlest eye, who art fairer
Than the morning on the sszirt of the mountain !
The valiant Conal has sent us to vifit theee
—Who thou art, and what thy country,
Or in what tower thou hast been reared,
And what moved thee to come to Edu,
Over the roaring seas of whitening billows ἓ
This Conal defired us to request,
And that thou wouldst go ὥρης with us to his dwelling,
To partake of the feast of the chiefs‚
And listen to the soothing softness of songs.'

Conloch, who was restrained by a promise made
to his mother from telling his name or country to
any but to him by whom he should be vanquished in
combat, declines thp invitation, and refuses any an-
swer to Conal’s inquiries. Beldearg and his fifteen
companions in arms fight with the young hero, and
are succeffively overcome. Conal himself, {nformed
of their ovesshrow, goes to meet this stranger hero.
His address to Conloch, and its consequences‚ are
thus related in the original.v
