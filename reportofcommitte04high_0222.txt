There are a hundred places in the Highla'nds and· Isles,'
which dertve their names from the Fe‘imze, and from cir-
cumstances connected with their history. The properties
of the grounds, and the traditione universsssy attached to
them, correspond with the strain of Ossian’s poetry. These
traditions have been handed down from generation to gene-
ration‚ and still exist. The names of men, and of olaus
or tribes, either prior to Ossian, or coeval with him, which
we can all mention, prove that the F'effinne inhabited our
Highlands and ‘Isle33 and we have genealogies of some
families which reach back to these early times, and to some
of the heroes whom he celebrated.

The names of men, and of places, are significant to a
degree, found only in an original language: and Ossian's
expressions are so peculiarly and wonderfully happy, that
110 man can translate or change them, without losing the
aptness, substance, melody, and perfect beauty, which
distinguish the pure G-aelic of Ossian alone, through an his
works.

Resides, we find over the Highlands and Isles many mo-
numents of the good sense andingenuity of Ossian's heroes.
These evince that they possessed arts that enabled them to
perform works, of which their degenerate descendants -
can-net comprehend the method, nor even conceive the pos-
sibility, of execution.

Among the powers with which the Faessirme had to contend,
in defence of their hands and liberties‚ or in support of their
assies, we have mention made of “ The king of the
World. ” There is no character to which we can suppose
this epithet applicable, excepting the Sovereign of Rome,
whose controu} extended over more of our Globe, than
that of any other recorded in history.

The scandinaviam (Lochlinnich) who invaded the Isles
and Highlands‚ long after the times of the Fe'z'nnc‚ were not
able to change the language, or to destroy the monuments
