all friendly to 'the pretenfions of Maepherson‚ nor
to the authenticity of the poems, as given by him.

The friends of Macpherson, and supporters of the ’

authenticity of his transsation5 complain that they
have suffered more from the ig'norance than from
the knowledge of their opponente, most os whom had
no acquaintance with the language in which the ori-
ginal poenis were written. They affert, that no mo-
dern could possibly write such Gaelic as the original
given by Maepherson in his Temora‚ and that to be
given in the publication, of which the aforegoing
specimen is already printed, any more than the best
Greek or Latin scholars could write what would
pass itself, on persons conversant in those languages,
sor the compofition os Homer'or Virgil. ’ This the
Committee must submit to persons who are sufficient-
ly skilled in the ancient and written Gaelic to enable
them to decide on the subject 3 and in order to give
to such persons an opportunity of forming an opi-
nion in this matter, they have subjoined in the Ap-
pendix‚ as already mentioned, the entire specimen
of the intended publication of Fingal, with the li-
teral Latin transsation given by the learned and in-
genious Mr M‘Farlane, employed for that purpose
by Mr Macpherson's executore.

regarding their genuineness and antiquity. There iz<
a considerable, though not an absolute uniformity in
