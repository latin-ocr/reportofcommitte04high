Ῑῦὕ ALBIN AND Tm:

The story makes each heart but thine to bleed,
And fisss both men and maids with keenest grief ξ

Behold thy daughter, beauteous as the sky
When early morn ascends yon eastern hius,
She 10v⁷d the youth who by thy *guile did die,
And now our ears with lamentations fills z
²133 she, who sad, and grovessing on the ground}
Vseeps o'ez· his ἔων-ελ and makes the woods· 1660111111.ς

Α. 111011ςε111ἀ graces did the maid adom:
Her 160113 were char-ming, and 1161· heart was kind}
Ues ey& were like 1116 windows of the morn,
And wisdom's habitation was her mind.
Α hundred heroes try'd 1161· love to gain3
Sne pityssthem, yet did their suits deny :
Yet-mg Albi& only courted not 111 vain, ἱ
Albin alone was lovely in her eye :
Love fill’d 111611· bosoms with ᾳ 1111111131 fiame ;
{Their birth was equalz and their age the same,

Her mother Mey, a woman void of truth,
In praefice of deceit and guile· grown old,

Conceiv’d 6. guihy passion for the youth,
And 111 his ear the shamesul sxtory told:

But o’er his mind she never could prevail;

For in his life no wickedness was found3
With shame and. fage he heard the horrid tale2
And shook with indignation at the sound:
Hc fied to Sbun her 3 while With burning wratb,

The monster, in revenge, decreed his death.

Amidst Lochmey, at distance from the shore&
On a green island, grew a stately tree,
'With precious fruit each season cover'd o'er‚„
