ΙΙ. STOIRM agrees in meaning with the German sturm,
and the Dutch and English stmm, which Minsheu in his
Etymological Dicdonary, derives fron the Latin sterno.
Had that learned author been acquz‘nttd with the Celtic,
he would have found a happier etymon in stoirm, which is
itself derived from coit-m, a lond murmuring noise.

The affinity which a number of Teuton5c words bear to
the Celtic is, in part, a natural and necessary consequence
of the first peopling of Europe, and the near neighbourhood
of the Celtic and Teutonic nations in ancient times.

Of the several races οξ men b J which Europe is inhabit-
ed, it is certain that the Celtic people were the first who
moved westward from Asia, the region to which the uni-
form evidence os history, whether sacred or profane, refers
as the original seat of mankind. For Herodotus, the‘eldest
histor-ian of Europe now extant, has remarked repeatedly
(Euterpe, C. 33. Melpom. C. 49.)‚ that the Celtae
{avere possessed, in his time, of the extreme westerly
point of the European continent. That they formed settle-
ments in the countries whics. they passed in the course of
their migration from east to west, we may judge by the
traces which they left of their narne3 Strabo having re-
marked (Lib. XI.) that the 01:ss writers of Greece called all
the northern natio-ts (meaning those of Asia and Europe
alike) by the name of Scythians and Celto-Scythians, and
Phny having given us to understand (L. VI. c. 13.) thar
the Lytarmis promontory, which is supposed to be the
Cape of 01))’ᾕ now regarded as the extreme boundary of
