MR. M‘PHERSON⁷S Pon-rm. ιω

The broken skull and shiver'd helmet strow’d‚

The sandy plain that reeks with human blood3

He gasping falls, and shakes the thund’ring ground,
And dying, toss’d his quiv’ring limbs around.—-
Thus falls an oak that long majestic stood

The tallest honours of the waving wood.
Deep-hack'd by the ship-wright’s unerring hand,
Groans, slow-inclines, and falling, shakes the land.
