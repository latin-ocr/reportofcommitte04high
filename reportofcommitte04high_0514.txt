336 'THE uma-n oF CARmL.

Fingal and Gaul, which was but a choice colop chopped {md
mixed with marrow and herb seeds : it is described thus,

Mirmora nan laothan saille,

Mar struth meal air barach gheugan 3
Is greadhainn nan lus ga charadh,
Do Mhomad armann nan geur-lann.

This mirmora and every other reward conferred upon
Gaul was claimed by CarrH, finding himself the bravest and
most accomplished champion among the sons of Finge&
seeing Gaul aged and unfit for distant services, disputed his
birth by dint of arms. The invincible Gaul and inveterate
Cari-il entered the lists, and engaged each other in wrestlin‘g5
whereby they could not decide the cause upon that day,
being both equally overcorne. The day following they met
well clad in armour, furnished with sword and lance (against
the persuasion of FingaD, whereby they shewed much cour-
age and bravery, and Gaul gave the decisive stroke to Carril,
who has been lamented by Fingal'sor many days. Gaul
fled and hid himself in a cave, full of grief and sorrow, not
:choosing to rely upon the sriendship of Fingal till his days of‘
mourning elapsed. · The poem opens at their engagement,
and ends by Fingal and the bai-ds lemene over Carril’s corpses
