POEMS OF ossmrz. 73

brightness without fwwn, thy light that is lasting, ·
,Ο sun? Thou comest forth in thy powerful beauty‚
and thestars hide their course3 the moon, without

ι strength, goeth from the sszy, hiding herself under

a wave in the west. Thou art in thy journey alone ;
who is so bold as to come nigh thee ? The oak fall-
eth from the high mountain, the rock an'd the pre-

own light. When the storm darkeneth around the
world, with fierce munder, and piercing lightnings‚
thou lookest in thy beauty from the noise, smiling
in the troubled sky 1--T0 me is thy light in vain, as
I can never see thy countenance 3 though thy yellow
golden locks are spread on the face of the clouds in
the east3 or when thou tremblest in the west, at thy
dufky doors in the ocean—Perhaps thou and my-
self are at one time mighty, at another feeble, our
years ssiding down from the fizies, quickly travelling
together to their end. Rejoice then, O sun ! while
thou art strong, O king! in thy youth. Dark and
unpleasant is old age, like the vain and feeble light
of the moon, while {he looks through a cloud on
the field, and her grey mist on the fides of the
rocks3 a blast from the north on the plain, a travel-
Ier in distress, and he ssow ᾗ]

* O thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers !
