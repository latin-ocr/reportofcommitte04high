DAUGHTER OF MEY. ’1οἶ

Ἱῖᾙῇς fruit, more sweet than virgin honey found,

On yonder lake your dauntless courage prove 3
:Po pull me of the frnit, now bravely dare,
And save the mother of the maid you love.

Wizh downcaet look the lovely youth reply'd,
“ Though yet my feats of valour have been few,
E'A‘y ,might in this adventure shall be try'd3 ἡ
Ι go to pull the healing fruit for you. ’-'
Wizh stately steps approaching to the deep,
The hardy hero swims the liquid tide: Ι
