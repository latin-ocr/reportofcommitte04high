that were then recited in the higher parts of Argyllshirm,
as were the poem of Dai·thula‚ perhaps the most beautiful
in the collection, called in Gaclic by the name of clame

book of Temora, known by the title of Bcis G-scaz'r (tho

and the description of Cuchullin's car and horses, one of

degree of liberty which he took can hardly be ascertained.
Different editions of the same poem were, as you may
well suppose, very widely different, from their having
been recited for ages by different persons and in different
place53 so that, without having the translator’s corrected
