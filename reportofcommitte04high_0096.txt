'78 REPoRT ON THE

terms 3 that the persons themselves had never doubu
ed of the existence of such poems as Mr Macpher-
son had transsated ι that they had heard many os
them repeated in their youth ε that listening to them
was the favourite amusement of Highlanders‚ *in the
hours of leisure or of idleness3 but that, fince the
Rebellion 1745, the manners of the people had un-
dergone a change so unfavourable to the recitation
os these poems, that it was now an amusement
scarcely known, and that very few persons remain-
ed alive who were able to recite them. That many
of the poems they had formerly heard were similar
in subje& and story, as well as in the names of the
heroes mentioned in them, to those transsated by Mr
Macpherson: that his transsation seemed, to such as
had read it, a very able one 3 but that it did not by
any means come up to the force or energy of the
original 3-—to such as had read it 3—sor his book was
by no means universally possessed or read among
Highlanders even accustomed to reading, who con-
ceived that his transsation could add but little to their
amusement, and not at all to their conviffion, in a
matter which they had never doubted. A few of
the Committee’s correspondents sent them 'such an-
cient poems as they poffeffed in writing, from hav-
ing formerly taken them down from the oral reci-
tation of the old Highlanders who were in use to re-
cite them, or as they now took them down from
some person, whom a very advanced period os life,
or a particular connexion with some reciter of the
old school, enabled still to retain them in his memo-

ry5.
