‘⁶ Righ thire na bhfear ngorm.--Literally., ‘ The king of

From its being wanting in all the editions that have been

sailed to the mouth of the Tiber, and appeared before
the gates of Rome (846), where they struck dread and
horror into the numerous pilgrims who resorted thither
from all the Christian kingdoms of the west. (Volt. Univ.
