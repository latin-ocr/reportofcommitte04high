And arrived at the head of the lake of Lego.

There came out to meet and conduct us

A generous youth, who gave me a salute

And gave a welcome to the twelve men.
When we had enjoyed the drink of the feast,
Branno enquired‚ “² What is your purpose? μ
What your special business ?”

Caoilt answered on our part,

‘⁴ The reason for which we came hither‚

And the whole of our business to thy house,
Is to seek from thee thy daughter.”

‘⁶ For which of you is she sought ?''

‘⁶ She is sought for Ossian son of Fingal.’'

‘⁶ Happy is she who will get thee,

Mighty hero of the camps Ξ

Though twelve daughters were mine,

So high is the fame of Ossian among the followers of F ingal,
That the first daughter should be his.‘’

The chamber so highly prized is opened.
It was covered above with the down of birds.
Its doors were yellow with gold,

And the sideposts were of polished bone.
So soon as seen by the genereus Eviralin
Was Ossian the son of the chief of heroes,
The blushing maid of whitest hand

Gave her love to the son of fame. ¹
We proceeded to Drim-da-horc.

 

gal! Happy is the maid that waits thee! Though twelve
daughters of beauty were mine, thine were the choice, thou

son of fame.'’
He opened the hall of the maid, the dark-haired Everal-

lin. Joy kindled in our manly breasts. We blest the
maid of Branno. Above us on the hill appeared the people
of stately cormac. Eight were the heroesrof ‘the chief.
