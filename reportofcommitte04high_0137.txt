⁸ Mighty man who hast come to us over sea !
The warmth of affe&ion has kindled for thee in my beart.
Thy hair is like the golden beam of the sun,
Which sparkles on yonder mountain. ’
Thy form is like the hanging branch of the vale,
Which the warmth of summer has covered with beauty.
Soft is thy brow‚ mildly move thine eyelids,
As the gentle breeze on the edge os the hill.
Like the bloffom of trees are thy cheeks 3
Long and full, Ο champion 1 is thy chest-
Thine eye is like dew on the plain of the mountain 3
Redder are thy lips than the strawberry.
Thy teeth are like snow which has newly falIen upon branc-hes&
Thou seemest like the sun when he opens on the {hudowy plain.
Fair and gentle youth of the anburn ringlets!
Great hast thou become, and goodly is thy prowesS.
Do thou now attend to the purport of my address,
Ο hero, who excellest in deeds and condu& !
What has moved thee from the place of thy refidence?
If it was to give me thine aid, great is my joy.
I have come in quality of meffenger
To inquire of thee who thy people are ;
Who thou art thyself, or who thy friends;
And in what place thou hast been trained ?''
“ That is what Ι cannot reveal‚
But to one who [hall wrest it stom me by force.
If I could declane it to any one upon earth,
From a person of thy bearing I would not withhold it.’'
“ Here stands the king of Ullin and Tennagorma,
Who is the fiercest among the heroes of Erin.
Conceal not thy story from me, O warrior,
Though great be thy might in the strife of death {³⁸
“ My story cannot be rewaled, ⁸
O Conal of the thousand battles !
For Ι am under engagement not to declare myself‚
Until superior strength do force me.’'
