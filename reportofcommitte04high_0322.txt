‘⁷‘ There still (says the Doc‘tor) remains in the isla'nds,
though it is passing fast away, the custom of fosterage.
A iaird, a man of wealth and emfflence, sends his child,
either male or female, to a tacksman, or tenant, to be
fostered. It is not always his own tenant, but sotne
distant friend that obtains this honour: for an honour
such a trust is very reasonably thought.

‘⁶ Children continue with the fosterer perhaps six years,
and cannot, where this is the practice, be considered as
burdensome. The fosterer, if he gives four cows, re-
ceives likewise four, and has, while the child continues

4 with him, grass for eight without rent, with half the

calves, and all the milk, fo'r which he pays only four
cows when he dismisses his dalt, for that is the name for
a foster child.

‘⁴ Fosterage i s, I believe, sometimes performed upon
more liberat ternis„ Om· friend, the young Laii-d of Col,
was fostered by Txffacsweyn of Grissipol. Macsweyn
then lived a tenant to Sir Jamcs RIacdonald in the Isle of
Skye3 and therefore Cot, whether he sent him cattle or
not, couid grant him no land. The dalt, however, at. his
return, brought back a considerable number of macalive
cattle, and of the friendship so formed there have been
good effects. *When Maesio-talei raised his rents, Mac-
sweyn was, like other servants, discontented, and resigned
his farm, and removed from Skye to Col, and was esta-

blished at Grissipol †·.'’

. Mr. flurs mistaken notiou of fosterage ‘⁶ being in ‘agreat

measure peculiar to Ii·e]nnd,” led him, by a natural asso-
