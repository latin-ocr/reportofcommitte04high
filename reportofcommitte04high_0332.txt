SPECIMENS of

FIy, Hy, foul fiend, and leave the mangled world
Top long thy prey, ah me! shall hapless man
For ever, ever feel thy iron rod?

Come, Peaee, come, life—beffiending5 lovely fair5
A thousand graces 'tend' thy placid reign,

Stretch thy soft pinions o'er a happy world
Draw the sharp weapon from the warrior’s hand‚“
And chace the jarring monster down to hell.—
Let Science saise on high her drooping head‚‘
And Muses tune the soulddelighting lay.—

Of war, and happiness far fliee from earth.

Absorpt from life, I join thy sable stain,

And turn my aching eye from dismal war.¹
