LETTER FROM MR. JAMES MFPHERsoN. 155

much obliged to you, for any other pieces you can send
me: lt is true, I have the most of them from other hands,
but the missortune is, that I fingi none expett in the Irish
orthography‚ so that an obscure poem is rendered doubly
so, by their uncouth way of spelling—R would have given
me real pleasure to have got your letter before I left me
Highlands, as in that case⁷ I would have done myself th:
pleasure of waiting of you, but I do not despair but some-5
thing may soon easft up, that may bring about an interview 5
as Ι have some thoughts of making· a jerunt to Perthsjhireg
Be that, however, es it will, Ι shall be always glad of your
eorrespondence5 ‘and hope that you will give me all cona
venient aSsistance in my present undertaking

I have been lucky enough to lay my hamis on a pretqy com-
plete poem, (md τ’νιιζγ θρίξ, concerm'ng Hrzgah-The amiquity
of it is easily ascertained‚ aud it is not only superior to any
thing in that lenguage, but reckoned not inferior to the
more polite performances of other nations in that way.—
Ι have some thoughts of publishing the original, if it will
not clog the work too much.

Ι shall be always ready xo aoknowledge the obligation
you have laid upon mm and promise Ι will not be migrate-
ful for further favoursj—If would give me pleasure to
know how I can serve you, as I am, v

Reverend Sir, ¹
Your most humble and obedient Servant,
(Signed) JAMES M⁶P11121<30N.

Please to send me your proper direction. I send this inq,
closed to ΜΓ. John Bisset at Perth.—A letter wfll find me:
by the care of Mr. Charles Male-om clerk iu the Post-of„

fiee, or Mr. Donaldson's bookseller..
