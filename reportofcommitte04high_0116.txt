“ Two several readings now occur for ten lines of the MS. which, aa
they are inconfissent with one another, so are they also -with the tenor of
the poem. For whereas fifty §vere repeatedly stared to be the exa& num-
ber of warriors ννῇο»Χ accompanied Fingal on this occafion, yet in the first
of these readings, twenty-seven only are said to have engaged Dayro, who
bound them3 though it is added immediately astet-3 'that an the warriors then
present were wounded, and Flan son of Morni ssain by him. And in the
second of tbe readmgs, fifty warriors are represented as saving their com-
panions from the s word of Dayrd, by a seasonabl'e exertion of valour.
