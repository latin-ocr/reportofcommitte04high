278 LACHLAN MAc vunucn's

son of Laehlan‚ son of Niel Mar, son of Lachlan‚ son of
Donald, of the surname of Mac Vuirich‚ before Roderick
M‘Nei1‚ Esq. of Bana, and declared, ThatJaccording to
the best of his knowledge, he is the eightcenth in descent
from Muireach‚ whose posterity had officiated as bar-ds to
the family of Clanronald3 and that they had from that

and four pennies of Drimisdale during fifteen generations;
that the sixteenth descendant lost the four pennies of Drimis-

those books are to be found at this day, because when they
[his family] were deprived of their lands, they lost their
