LETTERS To MR. MACKENZIE„ 'H

'I‘ he most formidable objections that have been urged
against ¹the authenticityof Ossian's poems, are those that,
are founded, or pretend-ed to be founded, on history3 so
that, besides getting auswers to the printed queries, even
if these should be satisfactory, it would be necessary to
employ considerable historica] research, in order to answer
such objections. ‚ You mention one made by Gibbon.
*vVhether he may be right or wrong in his assertion, (for
his assertions are not always to be trusted,) I have no op-
portunity of examining: at any rate, I think Ossian ‚is
clear of this objection3 for the Gaelic word is obviously
an epithet‚ (signifyingfierce-eye,) and might be as appli-
cable to any other as to the emperor Caracalla. If Mn
31⁴- in applying this epithet to Caracalla, 'should be

“ found in amistake, as I apprehend he is in this, and in ‚

one or two similar cases ; his mistakes‚ in my opinion,

make rather for than against the authenticity of the poems,

as a forger would not, by his own unnecessary commenta-

ries or conjectures, abstract from the credit of his §.ext-
Fingal, according to ‘the' Irish histories² died

¹ in the year ................... 283
Caracalla's expedition against the Caledonians

happened in ........ , ......... 211

Fingal could hardly have been intrusted with
leading the Caledonians on so important
an expedition under the age of ...... 25
So that, at this rate, he must have lived to

 

theageof..................., 97
Which does not appear credible, even from many passages
of Ossian: so that Mr M’---⁴ may have been mistaken
in applying the above epithet to Caracalla3 and if he was,
{he objection falls to the ground. ⁴
