LETTERS 'ro DR. BLAIR. ’31

the skill and dexterity of his men> in working them, and
their intrepidity in the greatest storms—-of which he gives
the most striking description. I can account for it no other
way than his having been born in Bndenoch‚ one of the
most inland parts of this kingdom, where not having ac-
6653 to be acquainted with that kind of imagery, 116 did not
therefore perhaps understand the original poems.

With regard to the authenticity of the poenis, they were,
by the traditions of our forefathers‚ as far back as we can
11366 1116111, ascribed to Ossian, and to the most remote pe-
riod of time, of which we have any account. It is a word
commonly used in the Highlands to this day, when they
express—a thing belonging to the most remote antiquity, to

I know not a country in the Highlands, which has not.
places that are famous for being the soenes of feats of arms,
strength, or agility‚ of some of the heroes of the race of
F ingal. However much the several clans differ in the tra-

the doubts of 1116 gentlemen who deny Highlanders the ho-
nour of these monuments of the genius and prowess of
their ancestors‚ is to invite thern to the Highlands, and to
bring interpreter-s along with them, that they may exa-
mine the matter themselves. You may assure 1116111 of a
hospitable reception; and wherever they go to, the gentle-
men and clergy will find out to them the old men who still
have in memory most of the works of 0551311, and the
‘traditionary history of the Fingalians. I would engage
that they should return home sufficiently· satisfied that these
poems belong to the time and country to which they are
ascribed. If any other material question occurs to you
