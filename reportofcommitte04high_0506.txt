5³28 COMPARISON

ΙΙ. MANos. The poems which bear this title, in the
collections of Miss Brooke and Mr Kennedy, differ very
'much 3 for the stanzas of Kennedy's edition, which extend
from the Δῃὼ to the 49th, from the 52d to the 55th‚ and
from the 62d to the 74th inclusive2 are 1iot found, either

¹ in partor whole, in the edition of Miss 'Brooke3 though
the style and sentiment prove them an undoubted offspring
of the ancient Gaelic muse. Of the first six stanzas of
Kennedy’s edition, four agree with ΜὶεεΙ Βῖοοκυεθε,ἱ as does
nearly the rest of the poem, with the exception of the
stanzas above speeified, and of the 7th3 which last is an.
address to the VVaterfall of Lothan, expressed as follows:

Eas mo chridhe an t eas so sfflas,
Eas rna an deana an Fhiann sealg ἔ
Eas eibhin is “aille srath Δ
Bu lionoi· ann lon is dearg Ξ

'Waterfall of mg delight, which flowest to the west-2
ward,

Along whose banks the heroes of F ingal used to hunt Υ

ἶῖῙεῑῖεῐὶεΠ that dost gladden the faircst of dells,

Which ahohnded with rcd deer and elks!

The history of the two poems is likewise different. In
'Miss Brooke’s edition, Manos, king of Lochlin,⁴ after be..
ing disarmed and bound b y Fingal, is set free by his gene-
rous conqueror, with permission to renew the general figh‘tz
or to retire with the vanquished host to his native land.
He accepts of the latter proposal with professiohs of grati-v
tude, and embarks., after pledging his saith that he woulcl
never lift an arm against Fingal. The translation of Miss
Brooke expresses with elegance the sense and spirit of hex:
