And won the praise of each deadly con-test.
T herr reuown shall remain in song,
Preserved by bards of the time to come.
Oscar ! do thou bend the strong in arms;
Protect the νυκτὶ of haud and the needy.
Be as a springude stream in winter

To resist the foes of the people of Fingal;

But like the soft and gentle breeze of summer
To those who ask thine aid.

So lived the conquering Trenmor3

Such, after him, was Trathal of victorious pursuits ς

And Fingal has been the support of the feeb1e‚

To guard him from the violence of the oppressive„

ln his cause would I stretch my arm;
W ith chearfulness would I go to receive hjm;
And he should find shelter and rest

Under the shade of my brightening sword.

On a day that F ingal had but few in his trah}
By the fall of Roya that softly murmurs,
There was seen to sail in the mist of ocean
A boat that conveyed a lonely woman,
lt neither halted nor rested
Tin it* reached the fall;
When out of it rose the beauty of female form,
She shone as a bearn of the sun.

 

 

‘⁶ Oscar! I was young like thee‘, when lovely F'ainasolli's
came: that sun-beam! that rnild light os love! the daughter
of Craca’s king! I then returned from Cona‘s heath‚ and
few were in my train. A white-sailed boat appeared far off ;

we saw it like a mist, that rode on ocean’s wind.

It soon

approached. We saw the fair. Her white breast heaved
with sighs. The wind was in her loose dark hair: her

rosy cheek had tears.
