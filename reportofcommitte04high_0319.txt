ΟΝ MR. HILL'S SPECIMEN. 14*

V. 3,--5. “ Ossian. It is a pitiful tale, O Patrick l
“ that thou tellest me the Clerk &cy [a mistake of the
‘⁶ translator for me qs, Ο ClerkJ] ‘⁶ Why should I be reli-
“ gious‚ if heaven be not in the possession of the heroes of
“ Fingal?”

·“ St. Patrzck. How wicked is that, O Ossian ἔ thou
‘⁶ who usest blasphemous expressions z God is much
“ more mighty than all the heroes of Albion.”

“ Ossian. I would,prefer one mighty battle, fought by
‘⁶ the heroes of FingaL to the God of thy worship, and
“ thee, O Clerk !”

V. 19‚—-21. ‘⁶ St. Patrick. He is now bound in hell,
“- who used to distribute gold. Because he was 3 despiser
‘⁶ of God‚ he has hell for 1115 portion.”

“ Ossian. If the children of Momi, and the many tribes
“ of the children of Ovi, gwere yet alive3 we would force
‘⁶ the bravo Fingal out of hell, or, the habitatio'n should be
‘¹‘ our own.” ’

“ St. Patrz'ck. Valiant as· you imagine the brave Scot's
‘⁶ were3 yet Fingal they would not release, though they
*Β should be there themselves.⁷’

It must be remarked, that an ambiguity which might be
alleged to result in the last of these verses, from the name
of Scots‚ which extended to natives of Ireland soon after
the age of St. Pan-ich, is occasioned by 3 perversion of the<
original;

ὅ( V. 21. Cion fheodhna na Halabinn maseach

‘⁶ Air leatsa gum ba mhor am feum
⁶4 Cho dtuga sin Fiunn amach
⁶⁶ Ged bhiodh an teach aguibh fein.'’
The literal meaning of which is this ;
The leaders of the host of Albion„ in su ccession,
Great as you deem their prowess‚
Could not effect the release of Fingal‚
Though the habitation were your own.
