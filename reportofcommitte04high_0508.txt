330 · COMPARISON'

(O ad reverse ! O fatal hour
In mangled heaps to die 3)
Too mighty Erin ! to thy power,
Pale victims, here they lie.”

Kennedy’s edition of the poem goes on to relate, that
after the fleet of Lochlin proceeded. to sea, the men, 3133311-
ed at the failure of their enterprize, prevailed 1111011 Manos
to alter his course, and steer for the shore they had left, to
renew the attack upon Fingal ; which eounsel proved
disastrous 111 the 133116, Μ31ιοε himself, and most of 111913
people, having fallen 111 the battle which followed their
second landing. This conclusion of the poem will best apa
pear from the original.

’S e comhairle thug na sloigh
Ar Manos mor na long {zigh
Tighin chuig' ar an ais o’n chuan
Go maithibh sluagh Inhsefafl. ’
Thill na laoich nan caogadaibh borb,
Bu mhor 311 1011111 31 311 tritigh. ¹
Mar fhuaim tuinne bha gach treud,
Is faram nan ceud ann 31· (1311.
Chuir Fionn teachdaire gu luath
Go Manos nan ruag is nan gniomh.
‘¹‘ Clite bheil do ¹mhiorlna mora
Fhir nach cum 3 choir ach cli.”

Fhreagair 311 Triath gu fiata borb²
Ar am biodh colg anns gach greis,

Ar an 1ὸ11 ud 51311113 dheas.''

Thug sinn an sin deannal cruaidh
Mar nach fac ’s nach cuala mi.
Mar theirbeirt teine na nial
Bha gach triath a sgatha 5105.
