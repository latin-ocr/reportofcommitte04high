’ξό LETTERS 'ro MR. MACKENZHL.

They flung their Weapons on the ground,
And in each other grasp the two heroes.
When thus began the struggle of the chiefs,
It was to us a weariness to be at rest3
The stones and the heavy earth
Awoke under the straining of their feet.
The victorious son of Cumhal lifted up
The king of Lochlin high on his breast,
And struck his back down to the ground,
In the midst of the ranks of Innistore9
Thus fell the king of Lochlin the brave,
In presence of all on the heath,
And on him, though no honour to a king,
Was put the tie of the three smalls, (i. e. his neck',
hands, and feet were bound.)

ΜΓ M.’s translation of xthe edjtion which he had of this
passage, is as follows: FingaL b. v. p. 62.
’ “ The heroes met in the midst of their falling {peoplffl
,There was the clang of arms ! there every blow, like the
hundred hammers of the furnace! Terrible is the battle
of the kings, and horrid the look of their eyes, Their
dark-brown shields are cleft in twain3 and their steel flies,
broken, from their helmets. They ssing their weapons
down. Each rushes to his hero’s grasp. Their sinewy
arms bind round each other: they turn from side to side,
and strain and stretch their large spreading limbs below.
Eut when the pride of their strength arose, they shook the
111113 wit11thei1·heels; rocks 1111111110 from their places on
high 3 the green-headed bushes are overturned. At* length,
the strength of Swaran fell; and ‘the king of groves is
bound. ”
