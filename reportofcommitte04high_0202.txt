‘28 LETTERS To DR. ELAIR.

9. From Mr DONALD Ithemon, Minister'of Glenelg‚
dated Glenjergr, (zoth March 1764.

Sm,

sometime before I was favoured with yours
of November last, with regard to the authenticity of Os-
sian's poenis.v I had a letter from Mr Alexander Mae Aw-
lay, the Highland chaplain‚ upon the same subject. I
rhen at his desire, set about examining the original poems,
and the traditionary stories of Fingal and his host3 and got
311 within my reach who preserved on memory any part of
either. This Ι found a work of some time and labour, but
could not without it answer your queries.

There are many poems ascribed to Ossian, more than
ΜΓ Maepherson has translated3 many of which, I dare
say, he never heard3 and of these not a few (in my
humble opinion) of as much poetical merit as any he has
inserted. Macpherson took too little time in the Highlands
and W'estern Isles to be able to have collected the whole of
them3 for, as the works of Ossian are dispersed all over
the Highlands, there is not a elan, through whose lands
you travel, but you will find some one of these poem-5
among them, which is not to be met with any where else.

The tradi‘tionary history of Fingal, though much intermix-
ed with fable, throws a good deal additional light upon the
customs and manners of those remote times. The old High-
landers commonly entertained one another with the repeti«
tion of these poems, and diverted the tediousness of thc
winter nights. When they met to watch the dead corpse of
their friends, they spent a considerable part of the night in
repeating the poems, and talking of the times of Fingal.
They often laid wagers on such occasions, who should re-

memory, was reputed not a despicable acquisition. Ι know
