Their burnished arms are laid afide ς

The strength of the heroes is tried ;

Stones and solid earth

Are overturned by their feet in the contest.

Iknow not if this makes any part of what ΜΡ
Maepherson detailed of the exploits of Fingal3 my
memory has failed me even in the very line in which
it is most exercised. Had its decline kept off, I
could give your honourable Society more specimens,
with which I had the honour of being early ac·-
quainted. Here I cannot get my memory refreshed.
The pride of ancestry; the fortia faesia patrum, are
obsolete themes: the preffure of the times, the
change of system, have brought forward other feel-,
ings and speculations. Little else is left us of the
ancient Caledonians than the refuse of their remains:
occupants hold their poffeffions, who are more able
to advance the interest of landlords‚ and who are
more attached to Plutus than to Mars, to Tellus
than to the Muses.

What Sir John Dalrymple predicited concerning
the Highlanders, at the close of the battle of Killi-
cranky‚ seems to be coming forward with hasty
strideS. Let Mr Laing read their character as drawn
by that masterly pen, and it will not seem to him
incredible, that a former age should, among the
Caledoniam, furnilh such a hero as Fingal, or such
a bard as Offian„
