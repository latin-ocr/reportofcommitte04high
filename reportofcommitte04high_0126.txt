108 REPORT oN THE

of that learned clergyman, his collation of many
of Kennedy's‚ with copies of the same poenis which
he had procured, and the insertion of many he had
received from other hands, besides those of Mr Ken-
nedy‚ it was rendered ,a much more interesting vo-

An Gmagach, Rochd, Ssthallan, Mslr Bhenm, Ti-

Dheirg, Bas Chuinn, Righ Liur, Sealg na Leana,
Dun an Oir, An Cu dubh, Gleann Diamhair‚ Conal,
Bas Chiuinlaich Diarmass Carril, Bas Ghuill, (quite
