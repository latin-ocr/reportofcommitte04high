But when in battle with our foes hc johs&
And sought the hottest dangers of the fight,
The stoutest chiefs stood wond'ring far behins‘h
And none durst try to rival him in might ἱ
His ample shield then seem’d a gnte of b1·as<‚
His awful δῖνοι-(1 did like the lightning shine!
No force of steel could through his annom· pass,
His spear was like d mast, οι· mountain-pinel
Ev’n kings and heroes trembled at his name,
And conquest smil’d where’er the‘ warrior came 1

Great was the strength of his unconquer'd hand,

Great was his swiftness in the rapid race ς
None could the valour of his arm withstand‚

None could outstrip him in the days of chace.
Yet he was tendet, merciful, and kind3

His vanquish’d foes his clemency conse-,513
No cruel purpose labem-’d in his mind,

No thought of envy harbour’d in his brem,
He was all gracious, bounteous, and benign,
And in his soul superior to a king l

But now he's gone ! and nought remains but wne

For wretched me3 with him my joys are fied,
Arouud his tomb my team-s shall ever flow,

The roci< my dwessing, and the clay my bed!
Ye mfflds, and matrons, from your hilis descend,

To join my moan, and answer tear for tear3
With me the hero to his grave asstend,

And sing the songs of mourning round his bier,
Through his own grove his Praise we will proclaim,
Α And bid the place for ever bear his name.
