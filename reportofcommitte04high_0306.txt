132 OBSERVATIONS

τὶς i t has been written from the time of its formation in the
reign of Henry II. had a being*.

He might have known, however, from the very song in
which it occurred to him, that bbist does not apply, as
beast does in English, to ever four-footed animal, but de-
notes a fierce beas& or beast of prey—the very meaning in·
which bestia is used by Cicero—Sexcentos ad bestias mi-
sisti ’ξπ

From this misapprehension ΜΓ. Hill goes on to present·
t‘o‘the eye of the reader a word purely English, which the
Latin could have neither lent to the Celtic, nor borrowed'
'r'rom it. D'fheudadh (they might) was transformed into
Dhefheudadh‚ a word* utterly unknown in the Caelio, but-
which3 from a similarity of sonnei, might be expressed in
English by the word dcjfhuted. So* that a future enquirer'
int'o' the authenticity of Ossian's· Poems, might, by this
means, be led to suppose that they were no older than the
reign of Henry 11. of England, A. D. 1172. when the> par-
tial conquest atchieved by Der-mot Mac-›Murrogh king of
Leinster, and Richard‚ surnamed Strongbow,.Ear1· of Stria
gul, introduced the English tongue into Ireland·:wlience‚ by
a singular hypothesis· of Mr².Hi11² (to be hereafter noticed)‚=
which he adopted in contradiction of the very poems he has·
published‚ they might be transplanted into the Highlands of
scotland.

A translation so very singular as that of scanza-7. above

quotedbfhadthe effect of raising a suspicion equally singular*
