With joy he finds the dragon fast askep,

Then pulls the fruit, and comes in safety back3
Thon with a chearful countenance, and gay,

He gives the present to the hands of Mey.

“ Well have you done, to bring me of this fruit:
Eut greater signs of prowess must you give:
Go pull the tre-e {entirely by the root,
And bring it hithe-s, 01· I cease to live. ’'

And pull’d, and tssgg'd it hard, from side to side:
Its bursting roo‘ts his strength could not withstand3

Eut long, ahs Ε ere he could reach the shore,
Or fis: his footsteps on the solid sand,
The monster foilow’d with a hideous soar,
, And like a fury graw’d him by the hand.
Thon, gracious God ! what dreadfu] struggling rose ἶ
He grasps the dragon by th'invenom’d jaws,
In vah] 3 for round the bloody current fiows,
While his fierce teeth his tendet body gnaws.
He groans through anguish of the grievous wound‚ ,
And eries for help3 but, ah ! no help was found!

At {ongtffi the maid, „now wond'ring at his stay,
And rack'd with dread of someAimpending ill,
Swift to the lake, to meet him, behds her way ς
And there beheld what might a virgin kin !
‚She saw her lover struggling on the ssood,
The dreadful monster gnawing at his side3
She saw young Albin fainfing, while his blood
v&Vith purple tincture dy'd the liquid tide 3
