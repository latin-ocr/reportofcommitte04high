Δ LETTERS TO DR. BLAIR.

The Address to the Evening Star claimed attention, on>
account of its inimitable beauty and harmonious versifica-
tion. The original of this piece suffered even in the hands
of Mr lWacpherson3 though he has shewn himself inferior
to no translator. The copyrorrssedjtion which he had of
this poem is very different from mine3 Ι imagine it will,

But after you have convinced rnen of the nieest taste in
Europe, it would be a mistake in any one to *endeavour to
convince those who have not the power of believing, or
