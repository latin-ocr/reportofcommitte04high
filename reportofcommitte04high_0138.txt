1 20 Rsspopsr ON THE

The heroes gave a hundred turns of strength,
By the border⁴of the sea, or'fthe smooth white bench,
The biast of their nostrils was heard across the hillocks,
And the noise of their feet in the struggle,
Conal was thrown down by the mighty‚
Who bound him, without a wound like the rest.
Arduous was the deed he atchieved
On the shore of the dark-coloured ocean.’

Conal sends for Cuchullin to oppose the vittorious,
stmnger, whose progress to the combat is described
with the same sublime and terrible imagery which

is given in Maepherson’s transsation of the Death of
Cuchallm. ²³⁵⁸

‘ thidh c liar le tartar uamhan,
’S fuaimneach arm mar Spiorad Lodda‚
Sgaoile gioraig is crith chatha
Fen an rathaid gu grad chorago

“⁵ The same passage is found almost verbatim in Smith's Ma-
mor. ‘ This paffage,' says Dr Smith, in a note on that poem,
(Scan Dana, p. 262.) fis much admired iu the original, and is
therefore inserted for the sake of such as may “understand it.y
Such striking passages, which, from the impreffion they make,
are in the mouth of every reciter, are often thus transferred from
one poem to another, when they are applicable to the story or
situation. The situation of Fingal in the poem of Manos is cer-
tainly better suited to this poetical description of the terrore of
'nis march, than that of Cuchullin in this poem of Conloch⁰
JI'he subjeft of this paffage is remarkable, as the Spirit rgf Lodu
<nas been a cause of disputo among the inquirers into the authen-
?iv-:ity of the poems of Offiam
