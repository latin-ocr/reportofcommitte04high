And in the ancient MS. which formerly was the
dean of Lismore's, now in the poffeffion of the So÷
c1ety:

⁴ Di wamyn beggane ssoyeg·
Ag ess royg· ny negg·in mawle
Di chemyn fa holt γι· lerr
Currych mor agus ben ann.

Keigyt leich yownych mane reie-
Fa mat· er gneeit· er gy· gart
Ffir yair neish is marg a eheith.
Di yowmist er gi teir nert?

There was a {horter and more rapid measure for
the lyrical parts of the compofition3 such was ges-
nerally used for the Prosnacha Cutha, the song of
incitement to battle, which it was the office of the
bards to fing, to animate the heroes when about to
engage the enemy. Such is the measure of some of
the odes given by Miss Brooke, and of the war-
song to Gaul, which is in the poffeffion of the So-
ciety. The opening of this war-song, as in one of
the Kilbride MSS. is as follows z its measure is quick‚
rapid‚ and spirit-stirring‚ each line generally cona-
taining one or two dafikyls.

‘ Goll mear mileanta,
Ceap na crodhachta,
Lhmh f hial aaachd,
Mian na mordhachta.
Leoghar luath adhbhal,

Leonadh lan biodhbhadh,
Tonn go treun thoirneadh,

Goll
