HUGH M'DONALD. 51

These things (and a thousand other arguments that
might be adduced‚) prove incontestibly that Ossian 1ived3
that he sung at a very eady period3 that many of his
best poems are still preserved3 and that no other hard has
ever been compared With him by his couutrymen,

VVRITTEN at Tigheary, in North Uist, on the 12ῒῇ of
August, 1800, by ΜΓ Edmund Mac Queen, Minis-
ter of the Gospel at Basra, as spoken in Gaelic by
Hugh Maedonald. It was read aloud, word for
word, at the house of Mr Mac Lean of Eooemy, in
presence of that gentleman3 of Major Alexander
Maedonald of Valay3 of Captain Ewen Mandon-
ald of Griminish3 of ΜΓ James Mac Qoeen, Mis-
sionary Minister, in Harri53 and of Mr Roderick
Mac Neil, younger of St Kilda: All of whom
declared‚ that, although what was spoken by Hugh
Maedonald, and thus written by Mr Mac ⁷Qpeen,
is perfectly just and satisfactory, with regard to the
authenticity of Ossian’s poems; yet, infinitely
more might be adcluced to prove, that Ossian lived
in times far beyond our modern period, and that
his works secure to him exclusively the rank of

the Chief of Caledonian Bards.
