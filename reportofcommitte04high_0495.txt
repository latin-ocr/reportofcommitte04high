m MR n. KENNEDY’S corr-Ec'rmN. 311

And many were the bards to sing the tale.

Many a shell went round,
Many were the new songs which were sung together:
Whilst the feast was consuming in the tower:
Beautiful and young the Fingalian heroes,
Joyful in their accustomed course 3
Musical, elegant, comely, valiant,
With wine, the reward of valour, and meat ς
Much beloved, unused to falsehood.
Chearful and happy were the heroes of Fingal,
The heroes, lovely, strong and friendly,
Of great compassion and extensive farne,
Who were generous, hospitable, and ever eager
To protect the stranger at a distance from his abode.
In the day of battle, on the field of strife,
Mightier men never were seen.
We would engage a man and a hundred,
Each F ingalian hero who was a leader.
We never moved but with reluctance
To give the impetuous battle,
To give the forlorn the protection of valour,
And the wounded stranger the shelter of our shield.
The numbers that were in my time
In Tara of the sweet sounding strings
Were fourteen hundred and fifty,
Of our dear friends without blame,
Without mentioning the young king of Phail,
Nor yet the wounded, the aged, or young women,
Nor the young men that waited on the swords ς
Alas! weak am I with grief,
Travelling the world to and fro,
And cannot find one person in it like Fingal.
In generosity and good fortune
None was ever found to surpass him.
