O‘N MR. HILL’S SPEc‘IMEN. 14}

‘⁶ The next poem is an account of the Death of Bran,
“ Fingal’s celebrated dog :” on which it is sufficient to re-
mark, that, close by one of the ancient ruins in ¹Glenlyom
described by Mr. Hill, as already mentioned, there is an
creet stone, called Conab'hacan, or the Dog-'stake‚ to which
Bran, according to the tradition of the neighbourhood, used
’ἕο be bound. Ι ¹

Traditions' of this kind‚‘ it is true, are* not peculiar to
scotland, but common to it with Ireland; where the scene&
of Fingal’s hunting adventures are still pointed out. But
they prove the fallacy of Mr. Hill's‘ observation‚ that ‘⁶ the
ὅθ song& themselves mention οηζγ Erin, or lrekind, its pecuu
‘⁴ liarities' and traditions.’'' Especially, as the two* songs
last named make no mention either of Ireland; or of scot-2
land;> and of the other five,· which he has pnblished9 there
are but fo'nr that mention Ireland‚ and one of these, which
mentions both countries‚ agrees with the fifth} which men*
tions Scotland alon2·‚ in representing the latter as the proper
land of th'e F ingalians.

Mr. Hill's error appears to have proceedfi‘ss in part, from
an impression which was made upon him by the first verse
of the*> translation of the poem which relates the ,Death of
Os'ca'r. ‘³‘ I am »very sad after thee, Chaoilte Σ since those
“ who were my contemporaries are departed. I am filled
4‘ with grief, sorrow,; and pain, since my foster-brother is
‘⁶ gone foom me.” On which he remarks‘in a note, ‘⁶ The
(ί intimate connection of fosterage herc' s'o strongly express-2
(ί ed, is in π great degree peculias to Ireland, a‘nd seems
‘⁶ strongly to point out the origin of this song†.''

Now it is certain that the intimate connection of fosterage
is no more peculiar- to Irelcmd, considered in comparison
with Scossand, than sadness after friends and departed conss
temporarios is peculiar to it 3· as Mr- Hiss might have
