'6 REPORT oN THE

na'ry course of human affairs, that it requires the ,
:strongest reasons to make us believe it. My present
purpose therefore is, to apply to you, in the name
of all the men of letters of this, and I may say of
all other countries, to establish this capital point, and
to give us proofs that these poems are, I do not say
:so antient as the age of SeveruS‚ but that they were
y not sorged within these five years by James Mac-
pherson. These proofs must not be arguments, but
testimonies: Peoples ears are fortified against the
former3 the latter may yet find their way, before
:the poems are configned to total oblivion. Now
the testimonie& may, in my opinion, be of two
kinds. Maepherson pretends that there is an an-
cient manuscript of part of Fingal in the familyl
think of Clanronald. Get that fact ascertained by
more than one person of credit3 let these persons
be acquainted with the Gaelic3 let them compare
the original and the transsati0n3 and let them tes-
tify the fidelity of the latter.

But the chief point in which it will be necessary
„ sor you to exert yourself will be, to get pofitive testi-
mony from many different hands, that such poems
are vulgarly recited in the Highlands, and have
there¹ long been the entertainment of the people.
This testimony must be as particular as it is pofitive.
It will not be sufficient that a Highland gentleman
or clergyman say or write to you that he has heard
such poems τ nobody questions that there are tradi-
tional poems in that part of the country, where the

names of Osfian and Fingal, and Oscar and Gaul, -
ἒ are.
