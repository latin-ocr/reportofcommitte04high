⁸ Long do the douds this night s'urround me—·³
Long to me was the night that is past-—
For the day that is come I have Ionged—
While ssowly ro'ssed the day before.
Tedious to me is each day that comes·,
For it is not as it was wont ἱ
Gone are the her'oes, my friends in war,
And feats of strength are no longer performed t
Gmemffly, the wil'l and the deed have failed.
'Sad {s my beart without an obje& for its' love,
Nor power to avenge the feeble.
Hospitality and t'he dr‘ink of the feast affe no more ,ς’
No more the love of the fair or of the chace,
In which I was wont to take delight.
On the sword or the dart I no longer rely.
Ῐ do not come up with the hind or the hart‚¹
Nor do I traverse the hius of the elk.
Ῐ hear not' of hounds nor their deeds.
The night of clouds to me is long !
