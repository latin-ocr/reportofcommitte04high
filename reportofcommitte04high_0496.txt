³18 zxmAcT oF A Poma, mc.

The heroes have gone to the grave
That sees not day,

Which has caused mine eye to be in mist.
I am like the lonely wounded bird of the wood‚

While I mourn without ceasing in the hall,
Without sight, or offspring‚ or cause of joy,
I am like the tree whose growth has ceased‚
Or like the nut in sts withered husk‚

Ready to 'drop down to the ground.
Grievous it is to the sorrowful heart,

That it cannot derive relies from friends.
Like the dying hart is my form,

My voice sinks under the dew of night ἵ
