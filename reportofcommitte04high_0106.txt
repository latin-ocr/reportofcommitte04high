88 q REPORT 0N THE

⁶ Sin, Killihuntly, aoth May, 1802.

⁶ I have to apologize for having delayed so
long to answer your favour of the 1 lth of Aprilss,
respefting ΜΓ Laing's application for the manuscript
poems of the late ΜΓ James Macpherson, in my lios*
seffion 3 but circumstances not neceffary to mention
put it out of my power to make the proper reply to
you sooner, ’

From principle, and from inclination, I am a
friend to nuth, and to liberal and ingenious inqui-
ry3 and, so far from having any wilh 'to withhold
information from Mr Laiog on this subje&‚ Ι sszould
, willingly aid him in his refectrclies, were it in my
power to clo so, whilst he investigates the question
with the learning of a scholar, and the candour of a
gentleman. *without wiz'hing to take any {hare in
a subje& of dispute on which I have long formed a
decided opinion for myself, I transmit you the ma*-
nuscript by my young friend ΜΓ George Maepher-
fon, Invereshie5 to be used as you please. I believe
{t can throw no light on the subje&; but you can
best judge whether it is proper to be communicated
to Mr Laing or otherwise. Had it been either given
‘co me confidendally, or come into my hands as one
of Mr Macpherson's executore, it should never have*
been produced by me3 butI leel no relqunce in
giving it up to you, as accident alone put it in my
poffeffion, many years before 4,Ι had any acquaint-

ance
