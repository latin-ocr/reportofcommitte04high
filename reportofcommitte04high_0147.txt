POEMS OF ossum. 129

p‘iishments are very considerable, but other men,
such as Clark and Kennedy, whose studies and habits
of life were remote from the cultivation of poetry,
who have either never written on any other occa-
fion, or whose writings give no token of poetical
genius or of powers of composition, produce to the
world poetry which, in sublimity and tendernesS,
will, it is believed, be admitted to be at least equal
to the compositions of the best'modern poets, ancl
but little inferior to the most admired among the an-
cient. Setting afide all the credit due to persons of
unimpeached and respectable characters, may it not
be alked‚ how imposture and forgery should become
muses to such men, should inspire them with the
fervour, the pathos, and the imagery contained in
the compositions which they have thus given to the,
world ?

In addition to the evidence arifing from the MSS.
or recited poems collected by others, the Committee
thinks it may afford some satisfaction to the Society,
to lay before it, what they conceive to be,

EVIDENCE‚ arifing from a particular examination
of the original (as it is termed)‚ left by Maepherson
himself, compared with his transsation, formerly pub-
lished in the ⁶ Specimen of the intended Transsation

of Offian's Poems,' which the Committee has mena
I tioned.
