GAELm MANUSCRIPTS. 303'

sponds almost exactly with Sliabh mim beannfionn in Ken-
nedy’s collection, p. 29. The number of verses is the
same in both, and even the order of them, with two excep-
tions which do not alter the sense. Some variation occurs
in the reading at the zoth, 36th‚ 44th, and 48th' verses. It
is observable‚ that the argumentor preface of this piece‚ as

nedy’s arguments, indeed, are frequently at variance with
the poems to which they are prefixed3 a mistake that may
have probably resulted from a disposition in the reciter
to exaggerate the subject of the poem in his preliminary
account of it.

A less perfect edition of this beautiful poem is also

nister of Craignish3 and another still more corrupted, was
written from memory by Archibald M‘Callum‚ and com-
municated through Mt. Malcolm M‘Donald.

which that bard made to Fingalx of Oscar’s having fallen on
the field of Gavra, corresponds very much with an edition
of Kennedy's (p. 143), and another of Mr. Malcolm Mac
Donald’s ; neither of which is inferior to the Dean's. The
two last lines of the following stanza are even more happi-
ly expressed in Kennedy’s edition than in his.

It is to be observed, that this report of Fergus the bard
appears in the editions of Mr. RI‘Donald and Kennedy, as
