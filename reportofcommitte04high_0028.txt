'm REPORT ON THE

that Noble Lord, at his defire. I believe him a very
good man 3 a better man than a politician.

Since writing the above, 1 have been in company
with Mrs Montague, a lady of great distinction in
this place, and a zealous partizan of Offian. Ι told
her of your intention, and even used the freedom to
read your letter to her. She was extremely pleased
with your projefih and the rather, as the Duc de
Nivernois, she said, had talked to her much on that
subje& last winter, and defired, if poffible, to get,
collected some proofs of the authenticity of these ,-
poems, which he proposed to lay before the Aca-
demie de Belle Lettres at Paris· You see, then,
that you are upon a great stage in this inquiry, and
that many people have their eyes upon you. This
is a new motive for rendering your proofs as com-
plete as, poffible. Ι cannot conceive any obje&ion
which a man even of the gravest character could
have to your publication of his letters, which will
only attest a plain fa& known to him. Such scru-
ples, if they occur, you must endeavour to remove ;
for on this trial of yours will the judgment of the
ι public finally depend-

Lord Bath, who was in the company, agreed
with me, that such documents of authenticity are
entirely neceffary and indispensable.

Please to write to me as soon as you make any
advances‚ that I may have something to say on this
subject to the literati of Paris. I beg my compli-
’ ments to all those who bear that chara&er at Edin-
burgh.
