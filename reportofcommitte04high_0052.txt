I felt for, because the transsation, highly finished aa
it is, did not them full justice,- in my opinion. If
there is any blame, perhaps the language into which
he writ should bear it.

Irecolle& (it was often matter of conversation),
that by‘worm-eating, and other injuries of time,
there were here and there whole words, yea lines,
so obscured, as not to be read3 and I, to whom
this was then better known than to any else, one
excepted. gave great credit to Mr Maepherson3
concluding, that if he did not recover the very words
and ideas of Offian, that the substitution did no dis-
credit to that celebrated bard, and this, as,I ,told
you, Ι then considered as one · of Mr Maepherson's
chief excellencie& ι

As 21‘did, at the most'early stage of the business,
stand convinced that Fingal was no impofition, you ⁹>
may gather from the above that Ι do so still, not-
withstanding what Dr Johnson, fortified by Dr
M‘Queen of Sky, has asserted. The latter appear-
ed to me the most intemperate admirer of Offian Ι
ever saw, and Ι both admired and envied what he
collected of the works of that bard, and the accu-
racy and pathos with which he repeated them, though
Ι am persuaded, at that time of day, he did not see
the original or transsation. ’

Iwas provoked, perhaps beyond measure, when
Ι saw a friend, for whom I had a high estecm, giv-
ing way so servilely to the prejudices of Dr John-
son. ¹I knew Dr M‘Queen fond of literary fame,

and* considered by several as rather vain of how he
' stood.
