:36 REPORT ON THE

Dr M‘Queen will be forgiven by many for his
cantion, because he saw so much of Johnson, per-
haps experienced, that he might dread contradic-
tion or opposition from him would be as running
the head into the lion's mouth. I think I can re-
collect, that gentlemen very high in the literary cir-
cle, and most intimate with Johnson, often left the
cause of truth and the field of contest to him, know-
ing the power and virulence of his sarcasms to be
such, as would irritate beyond measure, and which
he seldom restrained when opposed.

'Some years after the publication of Fingal, I hap-
pened to pass several days with Mr M‘Donald of
Clanronald, in the house of ΜΓ Butter of Pitlo-
chry, who then refided in the neighbourhood of
Fort-William. Clanronald told me that Mr Mac·
pherson had the Gaelic manuscripts, from him, and
that he did not know them to exist, till, to gratify
Mr Macpherson, a search was made among his fa-
mily papers. Clanronald added, that, fince Mi·
Maepherson's visit, more volumes were recovered,
and that he would send them to me, did he know
by what channel. I heard nothing farther about
them, nor indeed did I inquire.

Mr Maepherson’s tour through the Highlands and
Issands was not so early as 1756. His first appear-
ance to the public was by a poem called the High-
lander, published in 1757, or the very beginning
os the year following. In 1758 he entered on
hie transsation called Gaelic Fragments, and to this
work he owed his being called to London, and to

public
