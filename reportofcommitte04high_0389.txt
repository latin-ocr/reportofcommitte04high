or PASSAGES. 215

The choicest son of Erin’s king.

I desire the submission of Erin,

Or a shower that wo1unds shall shed amand her.
Th'ough a stood of tears should flow

From the eyelids of high-born virgins;
Though showers of blood

Should drop from star-bright eyes ;

The mourning cry of all her women
Would be heard as the screaming of sea-fowl on the shoreJ‘

‘⁶ Often have mighty heroes demanded,
· T hat Erin's yielded pledge should be sent over sea„
But never was it, nor ever shall it be granted.
Let the shell go round to us, ο
Let joy beam in each warrior's countenance.
O Bards! saise the strains on high. ·
Let the people hear the sound of your gladness..
Let rocks and vales at once resound “
To the joint melody of voices and instmments ᾗ.
And so let us pass the night
Tin morning shine with brightest ray. Α

Loud was the noise along the beach.
As the sound of a wave was [the moving of ] each tribe,
Like the rustling of a flock of seafowl to the shore.
[Their sound] was like a thousand streams

the deeds of other times. ³Send thou the night away in song 3
⁴and give the joy of grief.” Ib. p. 236, 238.

The sound spreads wide. The heroes rise, like the
breaking of a blue-rolling wave.-—They rose rustling like
a flock of sea-fowl, when the waves expel ‘them from the
,shores Their sound was like a thousand streams ssiat meet:

’ᾖ Many a voice and many a harp in tuneful, sounds arose. Fing. p. 2790
