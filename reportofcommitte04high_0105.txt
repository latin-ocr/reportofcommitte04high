produce the book which Mr Maepherson seemed de-
s1rous to confign to oblivion. Having arraigned
Maepherson at the bar of the public, as one of the
first literary impostors in modern times, Ι have im-
posed an oppofite obligation on his friends to vindi-
cate and rescue his memory, if they can, from the
imputation of forgery 3 after which no reason can
be affigned for withholding »the book, but that it
would serve for his conviciion. Such is the plain
state of the fa& 3 and if h-is friends are not at liberty
to produce the book, the only circumstance that
could suppose an obligation to suppress it, is, thui it
would serve for his deteffion. Very poffibly it con-
tains nothing to the purpose3 but the book. would
have been produced long ago, had it afforded a sm·
gle proof of the authenticity of Offian ; and, in the
impartial publicatione of the Highland Society‚ no
part of the evidence {hou-ld appear to be suppreffed.

I do not mean by this, that the book itself ssmuld
be pubthed, but that it should be transmitted to the
Highland Society for public inspeffi0n3 otherwise
i must ¹conclude that a part of the evidence, the most
injurious to Macphe‘rson‚ has been withheld by his
friends. I am, my Loul, with respe& and esteem,
-your Lordlhip's most obedient humble servant,

MALCOLM LAING.’
