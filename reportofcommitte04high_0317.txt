οΝ MR. mu’s SPECIMEN. 145}

‘⁴ the first book of Maepherson-’s Temora. It openz‘
‘³ with av lamentat-ion for the dea-th of Chaoilte‚ which is·
“ foreign to the rest of the song; a practice not uncommon
st among the poems attributed tao Ossian‚ and similar to
⁴* that of Pind·ar‡.”

Now, ῖῐι this poem we observa the following passages—-
V. 3} ⁶⁶ Did you* hear of Fi ²gal's journeys on every forest ,
‘⁶ in Erin? Great Cairbar with his armour sent for usto
⁸⁶ destroy us.” ἦ Be it remarked- that fhrest‚. in the English
of scotland, does not mean an extensi-ve wood‚-}bnt a moun-
tainous tract which is stocked., or abounds, with deer and
other game-

V. 6‚--152. ‘⁶ The lasst day of our drinking match,
⁶⁶ Cairbar spoke with his tremendous voice. ⁴ I want ue
‘⁴¹ should exchange arms, brown Oscar‚ that comest from.
‘⁶ Albion.'' Oscar. ⁶ W hat* exchange >do you want to
‘⁶ make, great Castbar, who even press the ships into your
⁰⁶ service3 and to whom I andss al} my host belong, in time
“- of war and bat-sse. Snrely it is appr-emon todemand
‘⁶ our heads when we have not arms to defend ourselvess
“ The reason of your doing so is our bei-ng deprived of
‘⁶ Fingal and his son. Were Fingal and my father with
‘⁶ us as they used to be, you would not during your whole·

‘f life obtain the breadth of your feet in Erin.

‘⁶ The. great hero (Cairbar) was filled with rago at th&
‘⁶ dispute· which arose between them. There were ex-
4‘ ceeding horrible words between Cairbar and Oscar.
“⁵ That night the women had a warm dispute about the’
“ heroes, and even Cairbar and Oscar themselves were
‘³ half and half angry.

‘⁶ Nine score men armed with bows and arrows, thart
‘'‘ came to destroy 1153> all these fen by the hand of Oscor
“' enraged at the sons of Irelz‘md †.”
