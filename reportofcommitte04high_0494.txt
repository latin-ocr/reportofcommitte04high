TRANSLATION.

Mournful it is to be to-night in the vale of Cona,
Without the voice of hound, and without music !
My fancy can no longer accomplish its purpose,
I am truly the old man and the feeble.

When we went to the vale of Cona,

Soft and expressive was the music that accompanied u85
Many were the men of worth among us,

Nor would we willingly incur displeasure.
When we would ascend the paths of Cona,

N umerous were the parties in every direction,

To subdue the hart and the hind,

Many hundreds of which were never to rise.
Many were the heroes, when called upon,

That would rapidly ascend the mountain

With spear exposed in their grasp,

Their great sword and their shield:

While my beloyed Fingal and fifty chiefs

Were assembled in the lofty court,

And the sun-beam‚ set to its flag-staff,

Waved over them its victorious banner.

Far would disperse asunder,

Through the steep bank} of each mountain,

The strong, adventurous band of Fingal,

With bows ready in their grasp.

When the deer began to start,

We let slip the hundreds of our hounds 3

NIany a hart, roe‚ and hind

Fen, as far as I could view.

We returned in the evening with the spoils of the chace,

To Taura of the musical strings‚ -

Where frequent our omits and harps,
