as obvious and natural an etymon as any that has been of·
fered by those learned authors. ¹

The ballance debt of words being so much in favour of
the Celtic was a natural and necessary consequence of its
speakers being the primitive settlers of Europe3 nor can
the origin of European languages‚ whether ancient or mo-
dern, be at all explained without the help of this primitive
speech. So just is κ’ the remark of M. Court de Gebelin,
whose opinion must be respected by all who make language
a subject of inquiry. “⁵ Enfin, voyant les memes mots
communs aux Celtes et aux Latius, &tre egalement en usage
chez tous les peuples du Nord et chez les Orientaux, on ne
¹sera plus tente de croire que les Celtes ne les tinrent que des
Latins; et la langue Celtique reprendi-a entre les langues, la
place qu’elle y occupa autrefois, et qu’on ne pouvoit lui oter
sans injustice, et sans se brouiller sur l'origine des langues de
l'Europe.’'

III. CR-UIT is the name of 3 stringed instrument used of
old in Scotland and Ireland, which was the same with the
Welch crwdd or crwth. For a long time past it has been
confined to North Wales, so that the people of that part of
the principality have been accustomed to consider it as be-
ing exclusively their own, as we learn from the Rev. Mr-
Evan Evans' account of it.

‘⁶ Praeter harpam aliud instrumenti genus sibi peculiare
Norwallenses vindicant, quod crwdd vocant.-Hoc instru-
menti genus fere in desuetudinem abiit, et violino cessit.
Ex sex chordis felinis constat, nec eodem modo quo vio-
lz'num modulatur, quamvis 3 figura haud multum abludat:
ln Sudwallia penitus ignoratur:

Romanusque Lyra plaudat tibi, Barbarus Harpa,
Graecus Achilliaw, Crotta Britanna canat.
