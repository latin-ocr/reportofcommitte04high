MR. MACKENRIE. 233

your assistance in enabling them to lay before the public,
I took occasion, in going to Inveraray, to call on ΜΓ,
M‘Kinnon at Glendaruel. Reminding him of what had
then passed, and asking whether he had himself seen the
Kilbride Collection, he toln me he had not, but that he had
then by him a Gaelic manuscript, got from some country
people in his neighbourhood, which had once, they said,

house in Bute for my inspection, all of which appeared to
me to be of some antiquity. Those were returned3 but,
at my request, Mr. Mackintosh was, as you know, allowed
to take inspection, and bring the Society an account of
these and the other MSS. in Major M‘Lachlan’s possession.
yart of these the major afterwards sent to the Society, and
