OF POEMS. 327

¹<flent ,name3 though it be likewise probable that a poet of
a later age may have purposely mentioned the Picts and
Sora, to give an air of antiquity to his imitation.

‘⁶ Truagh nach igcriocha Cruithneach
Na bhf ian fa fuilteach don-dha
Do thuitis a 6ig lt'lthmhair
No igcrich shulchair na Sorcha.''
p. 270. l. 17-20.

Which Miss Brooke translates,

‚“ Why was it not in Sora's barbarous lands
My lovely Conloch fell ?
Or by fierce Pictish chiefs, whose ruthless bands
Would joy the cruel tale to tell :
Whose souls are train'd all pity to subdue3
Whose savage eyes unmov'd that form could view?⁵
p. 23.

It is observable‚ that the three last lines of the English
are not warranted, in tho least, by the original of the ele-
gant translator, of which a close translation is as follows ;
“ Alas, that it was not in the land of Picts, -of the bloody
and fierce Fingalians, that thou didst fall, active youth, or
in the gloomy land of Sora !” Yet she may have very pro· Ἰ
perly considered them as the best that could be imagined
for the purpose of founding off her stanza.

But, whatever may have been the name or aera of the
authors of Miss Brooke's CONLocH, they are not to be
confounded with the composer of Kennedy’s edition, which,
though defective in some parts, and corrupted in others,
is couched in a style that fat exceeds it in stram, inci-
dent, and diction, and bears the genuine stamp of an early

age..
