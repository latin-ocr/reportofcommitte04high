Like a hart driven to fury.‚ -
Like a hawk among a ssight of birds,
Or a ruthless eagle pouncing in his strength. ·
Within the car is the strong-armed hero of swords9
Whose name is Guchunin‚ the son of Semo,
Son of Suvalta‚ son of Begalt.
His red cheek is like the polished yewi
Lofty the look of his blue-rolling eye beneath the arch of his

Like furious storms which come darkly frowning„
And rend the rocky peaks from their hius,
Toward each other approached the hostile heroem
Like cataracts which fall from mountains,
