POEMS oF ossxAN. 39

SIR, ·“ Kincardine, 4th March 1801.

As 1 have not seen Mr Laing’s history, I can
form no opinion as to the arguments wherewith he
has attempted to discredit Offian's poems : the at-
tempt could not come more naturally than from
Orcadians*. Perhaps the severe checks given by the

, ancient Caledonians to their predatory Scandinavian

predeceffors raised prejudices not yet extinc't. Ι con· ›
ceive how an author can write under the influence
of prejudice‚ and not senfible of being acted upon
by it.

Ι stand persuaded, that Mr Laing’s arguments
cannot stagger my belief in the authenticity of Os-
fian's poems. Before Mr Maepherson could know
his right hand from his left, I have heard fragments
of them repeated, and many of those fragments I
recognized in Mr Maepherson’s transsation.

Fingal's standard was my very early acquaintance:
‘ Togair Deo Grein e re Crann, Brattach Fhinn 'sbu
mhor a meas) The concluding confli& betwixt Fin-
gal and the king of Lochlin engaged my young fan-
cy so much, that the following stanza is still remem-
bered by me.

‘ Tilgidar dhubh 'n airm dhaithte‚
Fiachadar spaim ’nda laoich.
Clachan agus talamh trom

Do ghluaisd iad le bonn ’n cos.'
C 4 Ver-batim

³* Mr Laing is a native of Orkney.
