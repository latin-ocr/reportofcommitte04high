MR. M‘HIER'SON’s Pomm. 159

He stood, then stretch’d his sceptre5 an assound
Hang in attention to the grateful sound3

Down tow’rds the dust he bends his· reverend head,
And to ‘th’ Almighty supplicating pray’d3

O Great Unknown‚ O allacreating Minci,

In greatness lost3 almighty unconfin'd

To space or time, whose mighty hand informs,
The rattling tempests and the sable smnus,
Absorpt in light, O Vast Infinitudel
Incomprehensible Σ supremely Good3

Attend‚ O Heav’nly! from thy glory hear,

And to a <lust-formu worm incline thy ear,
String the firm arm, and teach the hand to fighrf·
Confound the proud that strut in morta] might,
All owns· thy sway, and at thy great command
Success attends the weak and feeble hand.—
Thus said, the devout monarch suppliant bow'd7-
And muttering prayers ran along the crowd.

In dazzling arms the chiefs terrific shine,

Glide thro the ranks, and form the lengthen’d line,⁴
While from th’ imbattled foe a hero strode

A coataof-mail hang& from his shoulders broad3
On his high-‘tow'ring head eventfui wav’d

A creste& helmet that the sabre brav’d3
,On his {eft hand he bears a spacious shield‚
Glitt'ring with iron terror o'er the field:

And in h-is right he waves· the shining blada.
He greatly swod, and thus provoking said,-

Ye Seots‚ ye nation fun of fraud and guile)

Ye mean descendants> of a baa-ren soil,

Let one advance (the bravest I demand)

And form a victim to my conquering hanes. v
Forget your fears, your wonted fears contr0u17
Let fate enlarge the ever-little soul,-·--·
