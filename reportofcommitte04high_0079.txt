POEMS oF OSSIAN. 61

This publication by Dr Smith, if not impeached
in its authenticity, your Committee cannot but re-
gard as very strong evidence in the question submit-
ted to its consideration and inquiry3 since, in the
poems publilhed by him, are to be found not only
the same strain of high and impaffioned poetry, but
also the same delicacy and refinement of sentiment
and feeling, which form so extraordinary a feature
in the poenis transsated by Mr Macpherson. Of
some paffages of one of those poems, ‘ the Death of
Gaul,’ the Committee will give a literal transsation,
which they think inferior to none of those given by
Macpherson, either in sublimity or tendernefs. The
transsation is given line for line of the original,
which, to enable the Gaelic reader to judge of the
fidelity with which it is rendered, is inserted in the
AppendiX, ΝΟ. 14. The argument of the poem is
shortly this: Fingal summoned his heroes for an ex-
pedition to the Isse of Isrona. A flood in the river
Strumon prevented Gaul from joining them in time ς
but he embarked in his {hip alone on the succeeding
day. On his voyage, however, he paffed his friends,
who were returning with victory, unperceived, and
landed singly on the hostile [hore. According to
the chivalrous idea of those times, he would not fly,
but struck his lhieldas a token of defiance to the
issanders, against whom he singly maintained a des-
perate conflict, till, fearful of a near approach, they
rolled a stone from above, which &striking his thigh,
disabled him from moving‚ and there he was left by
his enemieS‚ dastardly alike and cruel, to pine and

die.
