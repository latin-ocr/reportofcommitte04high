mavi). sm,
Ῑ am favoured with your last letter, inclosing

four poems, for which I am much obliged to you. I beg
you send me what more you can conveniently. I have re-
solved to print by subscription.—I send, inclosed‚ a copy
of my proposals, that if any in your neighbourhood incline
to subscribe, they send their orders, by your means to me,

and I shall send signed receipts‚ and take care to convey

the book when published. I am now much hurried, so
that «Ι have scarce time to thank you for your readiness to
answer my demands: I wish it may be in my power to
show how much I am,
Reverend Sir,
Your most hurpble Servant,
(Signed) JAMES M‘PHERsoN.
