‘remanebo MR. MACKENZOE, &a 63.

In answer to the first query, the committ ee will please to
know, that about the γε’) r 1 (405⁹ I heard John Fleming‚a
mylen? who in the manner of the country, worked nith
h· ιε journeymen at my father’ s house, repeat, in a ki 1d of
chiming measure, heroic strains relating to an arrival or
landing0 of an host and a subsequent battle, with a single
combat of two chiefs. This Ι took down in writing, and
kept for some time} but· was not in possession of when
Mt Maepherson’s publicatione appeared». ⁸I had no doubt,
however, in recognlzing the same passage in the arrival of
Swaran, and the single* combat with Cuchullin, in Mac-
pherson' s t1‘³”Slatlon of Fingal.

The few words I can recal, are, lst, in relation ῒοῘἪιθ
hosts enga( ed:

Ἀέέ Iomma colam, iomma skia, iomma tria, is lurigh
gharibhi
And ln relation to the chiefs who grappled, 3 ud n whose
struggle-—

eos.
The Committee will be so good as excuse my spelling, and
guess at the words as they best cau. As John F leming was
then an oldish man, he is probably long· since dead.

As to the sec'ond query-—the Committee will please to
know that I have, at different times, heard other semps or
fragments repeated ; but the principa] use I made of them
was, to tell my friend and companion at Colle-ge, Mt John
Home, that there were such relicks of ancient poetry in
1he Highlands‚ and which led him to me inquiries which
produced ΜΓ Μ3εΡ116ῑεοηέ commum‘cations.

The fragments I afterwards saw in Mr Macpherson’s
hands, by no means appeared of recent writing: the paper
was much stained with smoke‚ and daubed with Scots
snuff.
