,2³4 LETTERS To DR. BLAm.

thored together, than that which Mr Maepherson has given
to the public. The world may say of him and his trans.-
lations what they please; but I am convinced, for my
- Part, that Ι heard most of these poems repeated, since}
remember any ‘thing at all; and I dare Sey, at that time,
Mr Maepherson could neither read nor write, far less bc

the author of such a work. ”

T his letter, of which you are at liberty to make what
use you please, and the evidence which, in my presence,
you had from Mr Maepherson of fflornaway, afford a di-
⁴ rect proof that the poems of Ossian are no imposition upon
the public. I know nothing stronger that can be offered
to remove the doubts that may have been entertained con*
cerning the authenticity of these poems, and, I am persuadae
ed, a single testimony of that kind will give entire satisfac--
tion to every one whose scruples are not founded on pre-
judice.

I have wrote down the passages which ΜΓ Maepherson
'repeated in your house3 and. every one that reads them²
'allows that they lose by the translation.

Your acquaintance, ΜΓ Fraser‚ received a letter from ΜΓ
Μεῑε Lagan, preacher at Amalrie, in which he mentions
some detached pieces he transmitted to ΜΓ Maepherson the
translator, particularly several passages in the two last·
books of Fingal. The poem, called Erragon, or Lora,
:almost entire, and a poem which bears some resemblance
1‘0 the opening of Temora. I told you formerly that I saw
the originals which Mr Maepherson collected in the Hi gh-
lands. Mr Fraser will assur-e you that he saw them like-
wise, and was frequently present with Mr Maepherson
when he was trztnslating them: and no man will say that
he could impose his own originals upon us, if we had
common sense, and a knowledge of our mother tongue,
