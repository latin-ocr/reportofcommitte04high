δέ LETTERS To MR. MACRENZIE, &a

ance, and prevent the οὑξ-ἰωῆς from being legible by any
but those who were acci stomed to read Greek characters.

I have thus, mv deas Sir, given you as full an account
as I could of all that I ren·2e111bef concerning the discovery
and publication of the poenis of Ossian. I shall be hap-
py if it give any satisfaction to that very respectable asso-
ciation of gentlemen to whom you wish it to be communi-
cated, and to which I have myself the honour of belong-
ing, in the station of an Honor-ary Member. Ι have per-
haps been minute and tedicus in my narration of particu-
lars, but as I am now among the oldest persons ¹alive who
had any hand in that discovery and publication, I imagin-
ed that even some of the small circumstances I have men-
tioned, majr be considered as of some weight. I confess
I cannot avoid considering the discovery of the works of
Ossian as an important aera in the annals of taste and lite-
rature3 and the share which I have had, in contributing
towards it, as a part of my life, by which I have deserved
well both of this age and posterity. I have the honour to
be, with much esteem and respect,

My Dear Sir,
Your most obedient, and
faithful humble servant,
HUGH BLA1R.

2. From Dr ADAM Fmousson, dated Ηαῖζγανᾱπ, near
